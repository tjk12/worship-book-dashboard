Therefore, let us come boldly unto the throne of Grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in our time of need!                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |    3    |

Sing unto the Lord a new song! Sing His praise in the congregation of the Saints! For the Lord takes pleasure in His people. He will beautify the meek with salvation!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |    3    |

To draw near to listen is better than to offer the sacrifice of fools, for they do not know that they are doing evil. Be not rash with your mouth, nor let your heart be hasty to utter a word before God, for God is in heaven and you are on earth. Therefore let your words be few. For a dream comes with much business, and a fool's voice with many words.                                                                                                                                           |    3    |

For in the time of trouble He shall hide me in His pavilion; In the secret place of His tabernacle He shall hide me; He shall set me high upon a rock.

Yes, come, buy wine and milk without money and without price. Why do you spend money for what is not bread, and your wages for what does not satisfy? Listen carefully to Me, and eat what is good, and let your soul delight itself in abundance. Incline your ear, and come to the Lord. Hear, and your soul shall live; and He will make an everlasting covenant with you -- the sure mercies of David.                                                                                                 |    2    |

The night is long-since over! It is now daytime! So then let us cast off the works of darkness and put on the armor of light.

For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who in every respect has been tempted as we are, yet without sin. Let us then with confidence draw near to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in our time of need.                                                                                                                                     |    2    |

|   36    | We have an altar from which those who serve the tabernacle have no right to eat. For the bodies of those animals, whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin, are burned outside the camp. Therefore Jesus also, that He might sanctify the people with His own blood, suffered outside the gate. Therefore let us go forth to Him, outside the camp, bearing His reproach. For here we have no continuing city, but we seek the one to come. Therefore by Him let us continually offer the sacrifice of praise to God, that is, the fruit of our lips, confessing His name and not forgetting to do good and give generously, for with such sacrifices God is well pleased. |    1    |

|   26    | Saints of God, once more, we stand in need of our Father's cleansing and renewal. So, as Scripture calls us in many places to bow before our God in our worship, I invite all who are able to kneel together with me (giving thanks that we now have kneelers) and confess your sins. We'll pray first silently, and then join together for our corporate prayer of confession, printed in your bulletins. |    1    |

We have not loved You with our whole heart; we have not loved our neighbor as ourselves. For the sake of Your Son, Jesus Christ, have mercy on us. Forgive us, renew us, and lead us, so that we may delight in Your will and walk in Your ways, to the glory of Your holy name.

We confess every way in which we have not bowed before Him, or acknowledged His rule in our lives. We confess where we have gone along with the ways of the world, and failed to give Him glory. Forgive us and raise us from sin, that we may be Your faithful people, obeying the commands of our Lord Jesus Christ, who rules the world and is Head of the Church, His Body. In His name we pray, AMEN.                                                                                                                                                   |   15    |

Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin. For I acknowledge my transgressions, and my sin is always before me. I have sinned against You, O God, and done evil in Your sight. Therefore, You are just as both Witness and Judge. Truly, I was brought forth in iniquity, and in sin my mother conceived me. Behold, You desire truth in the inward parts, and in the hidden part You will make me to know wisdom. So purge me with hyssop and I shall be clean. Wash me and I shall be whiter than snow, for the sake of Your Son, my Lord, Jesus Christ. AMEN!                                      |   14    |

We earnestly repent, and are heartily sorry for these our offences, and we beseech you, by your great goodness, to have mercy upon us, and for the sake of Your dear Son, Jesus Christ our Lord, to forgive our sins, and graciously to help our infirmities. AMEN                                                                                                                                          |   13    |
|    5    | Lord God, eternal and almighty Father: We acknowledge before your holy majesty that we are poor sinners, conceived and born in guilt and in corruption, prone to do evil, unable of our own power to do good. Because of our sin, we endlessly violate your holy commandments. But, O Lord, with heartfelt sorrow we repent and turn away from all our offenses. We condemn ourselves and our evil ways, with true sorrow asking that your grace will relieve our distress. Have compassion on us, most gracious God, Father of mercies, for the sake of your son Jesus Christ our Lord. And in removing our guilt, also grant us daily increase of the grace of your Holy Spirit, and produce in us the fruits of holiness and of righteousness pleasing in your sight: Through Jesus Christ our Lord.

I am in need of deliverance from Your enemies and my infirmities. For this reason, I flee for refuge to Your infinite mercy, seeking and imploring your forgiveness and deliverance, through my Lord, Jesus Christ.

But I repent of these things, and am sorry for them, and heartily ask you for mercy, for the sake of your beloved Son Jesus Christ.

Who shall bring a charge against God's elect? It is God who justifies. Who is he who condemns? It is Christ Jesus who died, yes, who was raised from the dead, Who is at the right hand of God, who indeed intercedes for us.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |    7    |

Now the blood shall be a sign for you on the houses where you are. And when I see the blood, I will pass over you; and the plague shall not be on you to destroy you when I strike the land of Egypt .                                                                                                                                                                                             |    5    |

Let Your ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications. If You, Lord, should mark iniquities, O Lord, who could stand? But there is forgiveness with You, that You may be feared. I wait for the Lord, my soul waits, and in His word do I hope. My soul waits for the Lord more than watchmen for the morning--more than watchmen for the morning. O Israel, hope in the Lord; for with the Lord is steadfast love, and with Him is plenteous redemption. And He shall redeem Israel from all his iniquities.                                                                                                                        |    5    |

Blessed is the man to whom the Lord does not impute iniquity, and in whose spirit there is no guile. When I kept silent, my bones grew old through my groaning all the day long. For day and night Your hand was heavy upon me; my vitality was turned into the drought of summer. I acknowledged my sin to You, and my iniquity I have not hidden. I said, "I will confess my transgression to the Lord," and You forgave the iniquity of my sin.                                                                                                                                                        |    4    |

He has delivered us from the power of darkness and conveyed us into the kingdom of the Son of His love, in whom we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |    4    |

He will not always chide, nor will He keep His anger forever. He has not dealt with us according to our sins, nor rewarded us according to our iniquities. For as the heavens are high above the earth, so great is His steadfast love toward those who fear Him; as far as the east is from the west, so far has He removed our transgressions from us.                                                                                                                                                                                              |    4    |

So rend your heart, and not your garments; Return to the Lord your God, For He is gracious and merciful, Slow to anger, and of great kindness .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |    4    |

But for this very reason I was shown mercy, so that in me, the worst of sinners, Christ Jesus might display His perfect patience, as an example to those who would believe in Him for eternal life.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |    2    |

He also brought me up out of a horrible pit, Out of the miry clay, And set my feet upon a rock, And established my steps. He has put a new song in my mouth -- Praise to our God; Many will see it and fear, And will trust in the Lord. Blessed is that man who makes the Lord his trust, And does not respect the proud, nor such as turn aside to lies.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |    2    |

I cried to Him with my mouth, And He was extolled with my tongue. If I regard iniquity in my heart, The Lord will not hear. But certainly God has heard me; He has attended to the voice of my prayer.

But He was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities; The chastisement for our peace was upon Him, And by His stripes we are healed. All we like sheep have gone astray; We have turned, every one, to his own way; And the LORD has laid on Him the iniquity of us all.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |    2    |

Therefore by the deeds of the law no flesh will be justified in His sight, for by the law is the knowledge of sin. But now the righteousness of God apart from the law is revealed, being witnessed by the Law and the Prophets, even the righteousness of God which is through faith in Jesus Christ to all and on all who believe.                                                                                                                                                                 |    2    |

If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness .Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son to be the propitiation for our sins.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |    2    |

For we do not know what to pray for as we ought, but the Spirit Himself intercedes for us with groanings too deep for words. And he who searches hearts knows what is the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for the saints according to the will of God. And we know that for those who love God all things work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose.

And the Lord said to Satan, "The Lord rebuke you, Satan! The Lord who has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you! Is this not a brand plucked from the fire?" Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and was standing before the Angel. Then He answered and spoke to those who stood before Him, saying, "Take away the filthy garments from him." And to him He said, "See, I have removed your iniquity from you, and I will clothe you with rich robes." And I said, "Let them put a clean turban on his head." So they put a clean turban on his head, and they put the clothes on him. And the Angel of the Lord stood by.                                             |    2    |

|   38    | You have been buried with Jesus, by baptism into death, for this reason, so that just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, you also might walk in newness of life. Someone who's died has been set free from sin. We know that Christ, being raised from the dead, will never die again; death no longer has dominion over him. So you also must understand yourselves as dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus. Therefore do not let sin rule in your still-mortal body; Do not let it make you obey its passions. Do not make your bodily members available to sin, so that they become tools used for unrighteousness; instead, offer yourselves to God as one who's been brought from death to life, and make your bodily members available to God so that they become tools for righteousness. |    1    |

Now the blood shall be a sign for you on the houses where you are.

Our God is full of goodness and grace, which is why He has revealed to us His will, He has instructed us by His righteous law, and has granted His Spirit so that His law may be inscribed and impressed upon our hearts in such a way, that in all our life we truly serve and obey none beside Him. Through His Son, our Lord, this God is our merciful Father, not imputing to us our many transgressions of His law: but bestowing upon us manifold and abundant graces for which we must ever praise and glorify Him. People of God, for Christ's sake, all your sins are forgiven.                                                                                                                                                       |    2    |

But to as many of you, Beloved brethren, who abhor your sins, and resolve daily to abstain from them and to serve the Lord in true holiness and righteousness, believing in Jesus, and seeking your pardon through Him, and I declare, according to the command of God, that you are released in heaven from all your sins, (as He has promised in His gospel), through the perfect satisfaction of the most holy passion and death of our Lord Jesus Christ. Beloved of the Lord, for Christ's sake, all your sins are forgiven.                                                                                                                   |    2    |

There is forgiveness with God, that He may be feared. People of God, for Christ's sake, Your merciful Father forgives all your sins.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |    2    |

Saints of God, because of Christ, all your sins have been forgiven.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |    2    |

But, I say to every one of you beloved brothers and sisters who believe in Jesus Christ, and hate your sins; who ask God to free you from them so that you may serve Him in true holiness and righteousness: Have no doubt that your prayers are sanctified by the sufferings of Jesus Christ, and therefore acceptable to God. I declare, according to the command of God, that from heaven you are released from all your sins (as Christ has promised in His Gospel), through the perfect satisfaction of the most holy passion and death of our Lord Jesus Christ. People of God, for Christ's sake, all your sins are forgiven.                                                                                                    |    2    |

He does not condemn His people, but for Christ's sake forgives all our sins.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |    2    |

Beloved, our heavenly Father, in His great mercy, has given His only Son to die for us, and for His sake forgives all our sins.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |    2    |

But, to every one of you beloved brothers and sisters, who hate your sins, and seek pardon through the merits of Jesus Christ alone, and who resolve each day to turn from your sins and to the Lord, to serve Him in true holiness and righteousness: I declare, according to God's command, that from heaven you are released from all your sins (as Christ has promised in His Gospel), through the perfect satisfaction of the most holy passion and death of our Lord Jesus Christ. And since we do not doubt that our prayers and worship are sanctified by the sufferings of Jesus Christ, and therefore acceptable and well-pleasing to God, I call upon you now, to lift up your hearts! |    1    |

Guide us today as we open Your word so that we would no longer be like helpless children, tossed about by every gust of false teaching or error. Bring us to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to the full stature of Christ, So that, speaking the truth in love, we may grow up in all things into Him who is the Head Christ in Whose Holy name we pray. AMEN. |    2    |

You have made all creation very good by the Mighty Word of Your Power. You have established the order of the seasons and continually provide for Your creatures and make Yourself known to them by giving gifts and life and joy. Truly Heaven and earth are full of the majesty of Your glory.

And Your Word made flesh Christ, Who was FOUND in the form of an obedient servant; obedient even to the point of death on the cross. Give us the grace of Your Spirit to truly make His mind our mind to esteem the needs of others more important than our own; humble, even joyful, submission and support to the authorities You have placed above us, and joyful trust in You above all. We pray these things not only for ourselves but for all your Church in all the world.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |    2    |

Of all generations, ours is untrained at waiting with patience within time as You've created us to and as You teach us to in Your providence and Word. Forgive us for demanding to receive what we prefer right now, and for caring so little to even learn the patience of wisdom. Bear with us Lord, and grow us up in every way into Him Who is our Head, so that we may build Your Body up in love. We pray these things not only for ourselves but for all your Church in all the world.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |    2    |

We thank you for the gift of Your Son and the gift of Your Spirit. Grant us Your grace to live up to our calling as Your priestly people on the earth. Make us true worshipers of the Father through the Son in the Spirit. Shape and Strengthen us here so that in thought, word, and deed we may love and please You and love and serve our neighbor as ourselves. We pray this not only for ourselves but for all Your Church in all the world.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |    2    |

Search us, try us, know us - see if there be any dishonest or harmful ways within us. Purify us by Your Spirit and fill us so that the words of our mouths and the meditations of our hearts would be pleasing to You, and that by the fruit of our mouths this Church, our homes, our workplaces, and Your world would be filled with grace and truth. We pray this not only for ourselves but for all Your Church in all the world.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |    2    |

You know the needs we possess before we even think to pray about them or even are aware of them in the first place. Truly you are nearer to us than we are to ourselves. So hear our prayers and let your steadfast love, O LORD, be upon us, even as we hope in You. For from You and through You and to You are all things. We pray these things not only for ourselves but for all your Church in all the world.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |    2    |

We thank You for Your holy Word delivered to Your Church; for the faith which it has conveyed to men from one generation to another; and for the mercies by which it has enlarged and comforted our souls. We ask now with boldness and humility that You would mercifully receive the prayers of Your people who call upon You in the name of Your dear Son.

He is the joy of man's desiring; the One for Whom our hearts always hunger. Even our sinful desires are just twisted impressions of the God-shaped void within us. And our hearts are always restless until they find their rest in You. So shine the light of Your face upon us and bless us to draw us under the shadow of Your wing. Set our feet to walk on Your path in the steps of Your Son, our Lord Jesus, and fill us in our emptiness with your Holy Spirit.

We acknowledge ourselves to be that which we are, formerly aliens to the commonwealth of Israel, strangers to the covenants of promise, without Christ, without hope, and without God in the world. But now we are Your workmanship, created in Christ Jesus, so continue to strengthen us by Your Spirit that we should walk in the good works which You have prepared before us. We pray this not only for ourselves but for all Your Church in all the world.                                                                                                                                                                                       |    2    |

|   28    |                                              Gracious Father, You are truly our Father and have declared us to be Your children in our baptisms. Forgive us for our doubting and forgetting what You are like, and what Your Son has done for us, and what the Spirit is to us and in us. In Your Own words from Ephesians 3: Give us the power of Your Spirit, so that as Christ dwells in our hearts by faith we would be rooted and grounded in Your love. Enable us, somehow, to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth to know the love of Christ which surpasses knowing and to be filled up with all of Your Own fullness. Father, it's hard for us to even know what these things mean, but we pray them in the child-like faith that You will hear despite our ignorance and graciously answer in ways beyond anything we can even imagine, by Your Own power at work within us. And we pray these blessings not only for ourselves but for all Your Church in all the world.                                              |    1    |

You have commanded us to set our minds there, so do not let us be deceived by the allurements of sin.

|   39    | Our Father in Heaven, Give us Your grace never to leave the light of the glory of Your gospel. Guard and keep us from the temptations to stray that we would be vigilant against corruptions from within and without. Thank you for the legacy of Your faithfulness to the world through Your people to purify and keep us- that You are the God Who was, and is, and will be at work among Your people. We pray these things not only for ourselves but for all your Church in all the world. In our own community, we lift up to You the Catholic churches in our community Holy Name of Jesus, Christ our Redeemer, and St Mary's and Fathers Voyt and Johnson, Seb, Halsema. Despite the doctrinal differences that separate us, we thank You for the areas where their testimony has shown brightly in this corrupt and sinful world. Bless them and continue the work of Your Spirit to Reform all of Your Church, as you mature and unite us. That all who bear the name of Christ Jesus would do so faithfully and with a growing purity of devotion to Your Holy Word. |    1    |

Born as king in David's Line, but living a life of meekness to care for the lowly. His power was revealed in weakness, His majesty in mercy. His captors knelt to mock him, giving him bruises instead of praise, and piercing thorns for a crown. Yet even in His death, He prayed for His tormentors. So You have made a throne of their cross and turned their scorn back upon them. From the grave you raised Him to your right hand where He rules as King and Judge of all - Lord of all Lords and King of all kings. So Illumine our lives by the mysterious fact of His Kingship Give us victory as His faithful crossbearers and give us ever growing strength and unity through the body of Him by Whom and for Whom all things were created.

Receive us graciously, help us by Thy Spirit, and let Thy fear be upon us. Keep me, O Lord, while I tarry on this earth, in a serious seeking after You, and in an affectionate walking with You every day of my life; that when You come, I may be found not hiding my talent, nor serving the flesh, nor yet asleep with my lamp unfurnished, but waiting and longing for You. Cause us to be fervent in prayer and joyful in Thy praises, and serve Thee this day without distraction, that we may find that a day in Thy courts is better than a thousand, and that it is good for us to draw near to God.

Forgive us for our doubting and forgetting what You are like, and what Your Son has done for us, and what the Spirit is to us and in us. In Your Own words from Ephesians 3: Give us the power of Your Spirit, so that as Christ dwells in our hearts by faith we would be rooted and grounded in Your love. Enable us, somehow, to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth – to know the love of Christ which surpasses knowing and to be filled up with all of Your Own fullness. Father, it’s hard for us to even know what these things mean, but we pray them in the child-like faith that You will hear despite our ignorance and graciously answer in ways beyond anything we can even imagine, by Your Own power at work within us.                                                                                                   |    1    |

We pray these things not only for ourselves but for all your Church in all the world.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |    1    |

In union with Christ and His one sacrifice, we offer to You, O Lord, the reasonable sacrifices of ourselves, consecrating ourselves on the altar of the gospel, in soul and body, property and life, to Your most blessed service and praise. We thank You for Christ, the Bread of Life, and we thank You for this bread that is now before us. In partaking of this bread, may we truly partake of Christ. In His name. AMEN.                                                                                                                                                                              |   10    |
|    2    |       We humbly beseech You, O merciful Father, to hear us; and because of Your almighty goodness bless and sanctify, with Your word and Spirit, these Your gifts and creations of bread and wine; that we, receiving them according to Your Son our Savior Jesus Christ's holy institution, in remembrance of His death and passion, may be partakers of His most blessed Body and Blood. And we ask that in Your fatherly goodness, You will mercifully accept this our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving; most humbly beseeching You to grant that, by the merits of death of your son Jesus Christ, and through faith in His blood, we and all Your whole Church, may obtain remission of our sins, and all other benefits of His passion. And here we offer to You, O Lord, ourselves, our souls and bodies, to be a reasonable, holy , and living sacrifice to you. Through Jesus Christ our Lord. AMEN.        |    7    |

May we by lively faith partake of his body and blood, yes of Himself, true God and man, the only bread from heaven, Who gives life to our souls. Allow us no longer to live for ourselves, according to a corrupt and sinful nature; but may Christ live in us, and lead us to the life that is holy, blessed, and unchangeable for ever.

|   11    |              O Christ, You are the bread of life; our fathers ate the manna in the desert; You gave them bread from heaven to eat. Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and are dead. Moses did not give them the bread from heaven, but the Father gives the true bread from heaven. For the bread of God is He who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world. Lord, give us this bread always. You, O Christ, are the bread of life. He who comes to you shall never hunger, and he who believes in you shall never thirst. This is the bread which comes down from heaven, that one may eat of it and not die. You are the living bread which came down from heaven. If anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever; and the bread that you give is Your flesh, which you gave for the life of the world. Feed us, we pray, this day; for we come to the Father in Your name. AMEN.              |    2    |

May this bread be to us the body of Christ, given to nourish and sustain the people of God in all ages. Through Jesus Christ our Lord.

In Your wisdom You make all things and sustain them by Your power. You formed us in your own image, setting us in this world to love and to serve You, and to live in peace with Your whole creation. When we rebelled against You, refusing to trust and obey You, You did not reject us, but still claimed us as Your own. You sent prophets to call us back to Your way. Then in the fullness of time, out of Your great love for the world, You sent Your only Son to be one of us, to redeem us and heal our brokenness.

We are not worthy so much as to gather up the crumbs under Your Table. But You are the same Lord, Whose nature it is to have mercy: Grant us therefore, gracious Lord, so to eat the flesh of Your dear Son Jesus Christ, and to drink His blood, that our sinful bodies may be made clean by His body, and our souls washed through His most precious blood, and that we may evermore dwell in Him in He in us.

Feed us with His broken body and shed blood that we might die unto sin and live unto righteousness. By Christ Alone we eat and drink with Him at His table, knowing that we will eat one day with Him in heaven, and that even now we are lifted to heaven itself to commune with You and with the people of God in all ages. So bless us now, as we Your people, moved by your Holy Sprit, give you all thanks, praise, and glory, for ever and ever.

In Your wisdom You make all things and sustain them by Your power. You formed us in your own image, setting us in this world to love and to serve You, and to live in peace with Your whole creation. When we rebelled against You, refusing to trust and obey You, You did not reject us, but still claimed us as Your own. You sent prophets to call us back to Your way. Then in the fullness of time, out of Your great love for the world, You sent Your only Son to be one of us, to redeem us and heal our brokenness. We thank You and praise You for the body of Christ, given for us. In His name. AMEN.                                                                                         |    2    |

For You came down from heaven and gave life to the world. If anyone eats of this bread he shall never hunger and he will live forever; and the bread that you give is Your flesh, which you gave for the life of the world. Feed us, we pray, this day; for we come to the Father in Your name. AMEN.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |    2    |

May this bread be to us the body of Christ, which You've given to nourish and sustain the Your people in all ages. Through Jesus Christ our Lord.

To You be glory for ever. Bless our meal now. And as this broken bread scattered on the mountains was gathered and became one loaf, so too, may Your Church be gathered together from the ends of the earth into Your kingdom. Remember, Lord, your Church and deliver her from all evil. Perfect her in Your love; and, once she has been sanctified, gather her together from the four winds into the kingdom which You have prepared for her.

Grant us nourishment and life, not by bread and wine, but by His heavenly substance, which You have promised us to receive at His table. Bless us apart from earthly sight as we seek You now by faith.

Grant that we who, join in Heavenly praises, also - by faith and repentance - take to ourselves the love of heavenly life and righteousness. Through Jesus Christ our Lord.

With thanksgiving, we offer our very selves to You to be a living and holy sacrifice, dedicated to Your service.

Let His name be as pure and holy incense, through which all our worship may come up before You, as the odor of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, well pleasing to God. We thank You now for the blood of Jesus Christ, that blood that was shed for our sins, and we thank You for this cup before us. In partaking of it, may we truly partake of Christ and His sacrifice for us.                                                                                                                                                                             |    8    |

Because of Your tender mercy, You gave Your only Son Jesus Christ to suffer death on the cross for our redemption; and did institute, and in His holy gospel command us to continue, a perpetual memory of His precious death and sacrifice, until His coming again. Therefore we Your humble servants, celebrate before Your Divine Majesty, with these Your holy gifts, which we now offer to You: the memorial Your Son has commanded us to make, remembering His blessed passion and precious death, His mighty resurrection and glorious ascension; giving to You most hearty thanks for the innumerable benefits procured to us by those sufferings, death, resurrection, and ascension, Who, together with You and the Holy Spirit, are worship and glorified as one God, now and forevermore.

Grant that we may never relinquish these things from our hearts, but ever grow and increase in faith to You, which, through love, is effective of all good works. And so may our whole life be devoted to Your praise and the edification of our neighbor; through the same Jesus Christ, our Lord.

And now You have favored us through Jesus, Your servant, with spiritual food and drink as well as with eternal life. We thank You, holy Father, for Your Holy name which You have enshrined in our hearts. We thank You for the knowledge and faith and immortality which You revealed to us through Your servant Jesus, the Holy Vine of David. Above all we thank You because You are mighty.

We thank you now for this cup through which we receive the benefits of Your atonement.

And thus assure us of Your willingness to always be our gracious Father; not imputing to us our sins, but that we may magnify Your name by our words and works, providing us as Your beloved children and heirs, with all things necessary for our good. Fit us, O heavenly Father! so to celebrate at this time the blessed remembrance of Your Son. Enable us to profitably contemplate His love, and show forth the benefits of His death; that receiving fresh increase of strength in Your faith and in all good works, we may with greater confidence call You our Father, and evermore rejoice in You; Through Jesus Christ, our Redeemer, Who shed His blood that we might live.

And assure once more than You are our gracious Father; not judging us as our sins deserve, but rather, so that we might magnify Your name by our words and works, adopting us as Your Own beloved children and heirs, and providing us with everything necessary for our good. Fit us, heavenly Father to celebrate this blessed remembrance of Your Son as we encounter His love here. By the gift of His death give us the fresh increase of strength in faith and all good works, so that we may with greater confidence call You our Father, and evermore rejoice in You; Through Jesus Christ, our Redeemer, Who shed His blood that we might live and in Whose Holy name we raise our Thanksgiving to You today.

We bless You for His incarnation, His life on earth; for His sufferings and death on the cross; for His resurrection from the dead; and for His ascension to Your right hand. We bless You for the giving of the Holy Spirit; for the institution of the Church; for the means of grace; for the hope of everlasting life; and for the glory which shall be brought to us at the coming, and in the kingdom of Your dear Son. In Whose name we pray and give thanks. AMEN.                                 |    2    |

We thank You now for this table which You have set before us.

In partaking of it, may we truly partake of Christ and His sacrifice for us.                                                                                                        |    2    |
