All the earth worships You, Everlasting Father, with the Angels of Heaven and all the Powers therein, the Cherubim and Seraphim in their continual crying the glorified band of Your Apostles and Prophets and the noble army of Martyrs together with Your holy Church throughout all the world.  The Father, infinite in majesty; the Son, adored as the only begotten of the Father; The Holy Ghost, our Comforter. Teach us to worship You well, Father, Son, and Spirit Give us a never dying love for it and grow us up in it. We pray this not only for ourselves but for all Your Church in all the world.
