2023-11-05,"PRAYER OF ADORATION AND LORD'S PRAYER   . Lord God, You have sent us Your Spirit and so confirmed our adoption as Your own children to join the family of God. You have loved us as a perfect Father.  You have brought us to Your table and welcome us into Your home. You have surrounded us with so great a cloud of witnesses.  And in every age You have called men and women to give up their lives for You as martyrs of Christ. Grant that we, encouraged by the examples of Your servants and mindful of Your faithfulness in and through them, may persevere in the course that is set before us. Fix our eyes upon our Lord Jesus, Who for the joy set before Him endured the agony of the cross.  Now hear us as we sing the prayer He has given us   The Lord's Prayer     (arr. Nikolai Kedrov)"
