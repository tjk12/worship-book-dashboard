I believe in one God: the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth, and of all things visible and invisible; And in one Lord, Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son of God, begotten of His Father before all worlds, God of God, Light of Light, very God of very God, begotten, not made, being of one substance with the Father; by Whom all things were made; Who for us men, and for our salvation, came down from Heaven, and was incarnate by the Holy Ghost of the virgin, Mary, and was made man; and was crucified also for us under Pontius Pilate; He suffered, and was buried, and the third day He rose again according to the Scriptures; and ascended into Heaven, and sitteth at the right hand of the Father; and He shall come again with glory to judge both the quick and the dead; Whose kingdom shall have no end. And I believe in the Holy Ghost, the Lord and Giver of life, Who proceedeth from the Father and the Son; Who with the Father and the Son together is worshipped and glorified; Who spoke through the prophets.

1,2022-01-09,"THE LORD CLEANSES US < The Sin Offering > People of God called out darkness called to continue in cleansing and renewal - Let us humbly kneel, and make confession to God, imploring his forgiveness through Jesus Christ our Lord. [Pause ] Let us pray together O God, our heavenly Father, we confess to you that we have grievously sinned against You in many ways; not only by outward transgressions, but also by secret thoughts and desires, some of which we are not even aware, but which are all known to you. We earnestly repent, and are heartily sorry for these our offences, and we beseech you, by your great goodness, to have mercy upon us, and for the sake of Your dear Son, Jesus Christ our Lord, to forgive our sins, and graciously to help our infirmities. Amen. * ASSURANCE OF FORGIVENESS Arise and hear good news Exodus 12:12-13; 23 [The Lord said to Israel]: I will pass through the land of Egypt on that night, and will strike all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment: I am the Lord. Now the blood shall be a sign for you on the houses where you are. And when I see the blood, I will pass over you; and the plague shall not be on you to destroy you when I strike the land of Egypt . [To you, covenant people, whose homes are marked by the blood of the Lamb, and whose very bodies are marked by the water of baptism, God declares that Christ is our Passover and for His sake all your sins are forgiven and the righteous judgment which falls on the wicked will not fall on you]. Lift up your hearts! We lift them up to the Lord! (Please be seated) First Lesson Isaiah 43:1-7 But now, thus says the Lord, who created you, O Jacob, And He who formed you, O Israel: Fear not, for I have redeemed you; I have called you by your name; You are Mine. 2 When you pass through the waters, I will be with you; And through the rivers, they shall not overflow you. When you walk through the fire, you shall not be burned, Nor shall the flame scorch you. 3 For I am the Lord your God, The Holy One of Israel, your Savior; I gave Egypt for your ransom, Ethiopia and Seba in your place. 4 Since you were precious in My sight, You have been honored, And I have loved you; Therefore I will give men for you, And people for your life. 5 Fear not, for I am with you; I will bring your descendants from the east, And gather you from the west; 6 I will say to the north, ‘Give them up!' And to the south, ‘Do not keep them back!' Bring My sons from afar, And My daughters from the ends of the earth 7 Everyone who is called by My name, Whom I have created for My glory; I have formed him, yes, I have made him. The Word of the Lord! Thanks be to God! Second Lesson Romans 6:1-11 What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin that grace may abound? 2 Certainly not! How shall we who died to sin live any longer in it? 3 Or do you not know that as many of us as were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into His death? 4 Therefore we were buried with Him through baptism into death, that just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life. 5 For if we have been united together in the likeness of His death, certainly we also shall be in the likeness of His resurrection, 6 knowing this, that our old man was crucified with Him, that the body of sin might be done away with, that we should no longer be slaves of sin. 7 For he who has died has been freed from sin. 8 Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with Him, 9 knowing that Christ, having been raised from the dead, dies no more. Death no longer has dominion over Him. 10 For the death that He died, He died to sin once for all; but the life that He lives, He lives to God. 11 Likewise you also, reckon yourselves to be dead indeed to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus our Lord. The Word of the Lord! Thanks be to God! (Now RISE for our Gospel Lesson and song) Gospel Lesson Luke 3:15-22 The Gospel of the Kingdom! Praise be to the Lord Jesus Christ!

And to one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one, to each according to his own ability; and immediately he went on a journey. Our Gracious Heavenly Father, every good and perfect gift comes down from You to us in various measures and ways; in diverse talents and abilities, kindly granted for our good and the health of Christ's body.

Gracious Father, You are truly our Father and have declared us to be Your children in our baptisms. Forgive us for our doubting and forgetting what You are like, and what Your Son has done for us, and what the Spirit is to us and in us. In Your Own words from Ephesians 3: Give us the power of Your Spirit, so that as Christ dwells in our hearts by faith we would be rooted and grounded in Your love. Enable us, somehow, to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth to know the love of Christ which surpasses knowing and to be filled up with all of Your Own fullness. Father, it's hard for us to even know what these things mean, but we pray them in the child-like faith that You will hear despite our ignorance and graciously answer in ways beyond anything we can even imagine, by Your Own power at work within us. And we pray these blessings not only for ourselves but for all Your Church in all the world. In our own community, we lift up to You Sovereign Grace Church and pastor Bill Cain.

Bless their personal and family life, the children in their schooling, and guard and uphold their health in this season. OH LORD, HEAR OUR PRAYERS. For You are gracious. And now our Father as we come to Your table, we can only do so because You have shown mercy to every nation and have called us out of our darkness into Your Kingdom; to join the company of Saints, and martyrs, and confessors; the faithful from every age who have witnessed a good confession, as Your chosen vessels of grace and light to the world. Give us grace so to follow them as they followed Christ; to whom with You and the Holy Spirit be all honor and glory, world without end, Amen. Nicene Creed Christians, in Whom do you trust?

We thank You for the love that You have lavished upon us, so that even we might be called Your children. Continue to pour out that love to us and from us. For we praise You and ask these things in the strong name of Jesus our Lord, singing together the prayer He has given us: The Lord's Prayer (arr. Nikolai Kedrov) Our Father, who art in Heaven, Hallowed be Thy Name. Thy Kingdom Come. Thy will be done, on earth as it is in Heaven.

Let us pray together Have mercy upon me, O God, According to Your loving-kindness; According to the multitude of Your tender mercies, Blot out my transgressions. Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity, And cleanse me from my sin. For I acknowledge my transgressions, And my sin is always before me. Against You, You only, have I sinned, And done this evil in Your sight That You may be found just when You speak, And blameless when You judge. Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity, And in sin my mother conceived me. Behold, You desire truth in the inward parts, And in the hidden part You will make me to know wisdom. Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean; Wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow. Amen! Arise and hear good news Psalm 32:1-5 Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered. Blessed is the man to whom the Lord does not impute iniquity, and in whose spirit there is no guile. When I kept silent, my bones grew old through my groaning all the day long. For day and night Your hand was heavy upon me; my vitality was turned into the drought of summer. I acknowledged my sin to You, and my iniquity I have not hidden. I said, ""I will confess my transgression to the Lord,"" and You forgave the iniquity of my sin. [Your Heavenly Father, in His great mercy, has given His only Son to die for us, and for His sake forgives us all our sins. To all who confess their sin to God and seek His forgiveness, to those in whose spirit there is no guile, who acknowledge their sin and do not hide their iniquity, God covers your sin, and does not impute your iniquity, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. ] Lift up your hearts! People: We lift them up to the Lord. (Please be seated) How Shall We Then Live? Let us hear from God's Word. First Lesson Isaiah 62:1-5 For Zion's sake I will not hold My peace, And for Jerusalem's sake I will not rest, Until her righteousness goes forth as brightness, And her salvation as a lamp that burns. 2 The Gentiles shall see your righteousness, And all kings your glory. You shall be called by a new name, Which the mouth of the Lord will name. 3 You shall also be a crown of glory In the hand of the Lord, And a royal diadem In the hand of your God. 4 You shall no longer be termed Forsaken, Nor shall your land any more be termed Desolate; But you shall be called Hephzibah, and your land Beulah; For the Lord delights in you, And your land shall be married. 5 For as a young man marries a virgin, So shall your sons marry you; And as the bridegroom rejoices over the bride, So shall your God rejoice over you. The Word of the Lord! Thanks be to God! Second Lesson 1 Corinthians 12:1-11 Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I do not want you to be ignorant: 2 You know that you were Gentiles, carried away to these dumb idols, however you were led. 3 Therefore I make known to you that no one speaking by the Spirit of God calls Jesus accursed, and no one can say that Jesus is Lord except by the Holy Spirit. 4 There are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit. 5 There are differences of ministries, but the same Lord. 6 And there are diversities of activities, but it is the same God who works all in all. 7 But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to each one for the profit of all: 8 for to one is given the word of wisdom through the Spirit, to another the word of knowledge through the same Spirit, 9 to another faith by the same Spirit, to another gifts of healings by the same Spirit, 10 to another the working of miracles, to another prophecy, to another discerning of spirits, to another different kinds of tongues, to another the interpretation of tongues. 11 But one and the same Spirit works all these things, distributing to each one individually as He wills.

As You are the God of Power, be our refuge and strength, through Jesus Christ our Lord and by Your Holy Spirit, now and forever. Amen. (Please be seated) Preaching of the Word Pastor Ben Rossell Prayer of Consecration THE LORD COLLECTS OUR GIFTS Offertory How Sweet and Awful Presentation of Tithes and Offering January 16th-MATTHEW 25:31-40 "" When the Son of Man comes in His glory, and all the holy angels with Him, then He will sit on the throne of His glory. All the nations will be gathered before Him, and He will separate them one from another, as a shepherd divides his sheep from the goats. And He will set the sheep on His right hand, but the goats on the left. Then the King will say to those on His right hand, 'Come, you blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world: for I was hungry and you gave Me food; I was thirsty and you gave Me drink; I was a stranger and you took Me in; I was naked and you clothed Me; I was sick and you visited Me; I was in prison and you came to Me.' Then the righteous will answer Him, saying, 'Lord, when did we see You hungry and feed You, or thirsty and give You drink? When did we see You a stranger and take You in, or naked and clothe You? Or when did we see You sick, or in prison, and come to You?' And the King will answer and say to them, 'Assuredly, I say to you, inasmuch as you did it to one of the least of these My brethren, you did it to Me.' Our Gracious Heavenly Father, guard us from the great sin of indifference to the needs and care of the least of our brethren. You have taught us that we will be judged by our response to these, and that by ministering to Your people in difficult circumstances, we are actually ministering to You. Give us wisdom and grace to be faithful to Your Word which teaches us that He who has pity on the poor lends to the Lord, and He will pay back what he has given (Prov.19:17). We give ourselves to You, with these offerings today, bless them to be useful in Your service. For we ask it in the name of Your Son Jesus Christ, who lived and died in care and provision for us. AMEN. Now Rise! And pray together with me for the Church and the world! Gracious Father, We thank You for Your Son, our Lord Jesus. He is the joy of man's desiring; the One for Whom our hearts always hunger. Even our sinful desires are just twisted impressions of the God-shaped void within us. And our hearts are always restless until they find their rest in You. So shine the light of Your face upon us and bless us to draw us under the shadow of Your wing. Set our feet to walk on Your path in the steps of Your Son, our Lord Jesus, and fill us in our emptiness with your Holy Spirit. We pray these things not only for ourselves, but for all Your Church in all the world In our own community, we lift up to You: Cornerstone Church of Valparaiso and their pastoral search. Grant him Your wisdom and grace pour out Your peace and love in and through that body. Grow them, both in numbers and in Your knowledge and purity make them fruitful to abound in faithfulness and righteousness as Your people and lights to our community. Thomas and Julie uphold their family's health and grant them travelling mercies, both in their planning and also in the process of their travels remove all air sickness and sustain them as they return and bless their work as they resume it. Outside of our community, we lift up to You Your persecuted people all over the world, especially lifting up to You those in IRAQ where others threaten and attack them because they bear the name of Your Son, Christ. Bring healing to those who survive. Especially, we lift up to You the fatherless and orphans - continue to protect and provide for them there through Your ministries like Center of Hope Christian School and continue to grow Your Church in that land.

I believe in one God: the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth, and of all things visible and invisible; And in one Lord, Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son of God, begotten of His Father before all worlds, God of God, Light of Light, very God of very God, begotten, not made, being of one substance with the Father; by Whom all things were made; Who for us men, and for our salvation, came down from Heaven, and was incarnate by the Holy Ghost of the virgin, Mary, and was made man; and was crucified also for us under Pontius Pilate; He suffered, and was buried, and the third day He rose again according to the Scriptures; and ascended into Heaven, and sitteth at the right hand of the Father; and He shall come again with glory to judge both the quick and the dead; Whose kingdom shall have no end. And I believe in the Holy Ghost, the Lord and Giver of life, Who proceedeth from the Father and the Son; Who with the Father and the Son together is worshipped and glorified; Who spoke through the prophets.

(Please Kneel) Let us pray together Have mercy upon me, O God, According to Your loving-kindness; According to the multitude of Your tender mercies, Blot out my transgressions. Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity, And cleanse me from my sin. For I acknowledge my transgressions, And my sin is always before me. I have sinned against You, O God, and done evil in Your sight. Therefore, You are just as both Witness and Judge. Truly, I was brought forth in iniquity, And in sin my mother conceived me. Behold, You desire truth in the inward parts, And in the hidden part You will make me to know wisdom. So cleanse and forgive me, Heavenly Father, for the sake of Your Son, my Lord, Jesus Christ. Amen! Cleansing of Sin Rise and hear the good news of God's forgiveness.

But to as many of you, Beloved brethren, who abhor your sins, and resolve daily to abstain from them and to serve the Lord in true holiness and righteousness, believing in Jesus, and seeking your pardon through Him, and I declare, according to the command of God, that you are released in heaven from all your sins, (as He has promised in His gospel), through the perfect satisfaction of the most holy passion and death of our Lord Jesus Christ.

First Lesson Jeremiah 17:5-8 5 Thus says the Lord: Cursed is the man who trusts in man And makes flesh his strength, Whose heart departs from the Lord. 6 For he shall be like a shrub in the desert, And shall not see when good comes, But shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness, In a salt land which is not inhabited. 7 Blessed is the man who trusts in the Lord, And whose hope is the Lord. 8 For he shall be like a tree planted by the waters, Which spreads out its roots by the river, And will not fear when heat comes; But its leaf will be green, And will not be anxious in the year of drought, Nor will cease from yielding fruit. the Lord! Second Lesson 1 Corinthians 15:1-20 Moreover, brethren, I declare to you the gospel which I preached to you, which also you received and in which you stand, 2 by which also you are saved, if you hold fast that word which I preached to you unless you believed in vain. 3 For I delivered to you first of all that which I also received: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, 4 and that He was buried, and that He rose again the third day according to the Scriptures, 5 and that He was seen by Cephas, then by the twelve. 6 After that He was seen by over five hundred brethren at once, of whom the greater part remain to the present, but some have fallen asleep. 7 After that He was seen by James, then by all the apostles. 8 Then last of all He was seen by me also, as by one born out of due time. 9 For I am the least of the apostles, who am not worthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God. 10 But by the grace of God I am what I am, and His grace toward me was not in vain; but I labored more abundantly than they all, yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me. 11 Therefore, whether it was I or they, so we preach and so you believed. 12 Now if Christ is preached that He has been raised from the dead, how do some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead? 13 But if there is no resurrection of the dead, then Christ is not risen. 14 And if Christ is not risen, then our preaching is empty and your faith is also empty. 15 Yes, and we are found false witnesses of God, because we have testified of God that He raised up Christ, whom He did not raise up if in fact the dead do not rise. 16 For if the dead do not rise, then Christ is not risen. 17 And if Christ is not risen, your faith is futile; you are still in your sins! 18 Then also those who have [a]fallen asleep in Christ have perished. 19 If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men the most pitiable. 20 But now Christ is risen from the dead, and has become the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep. the Lord!

It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God."" And they were greatly astonished, saying among themselves, ""Who then can be saved?"" But Jesus looked at them and said, ""With men it is impossible, but not with God; for with God all things are possible."" Our Gracious Heavenly Father, we thank You that with You all things are possible. Like the disciples, we are amazed that any of us, who enjoy an abundance of Your material provision and comfort, may be saved.

Then he said: I am Joseph your brother, whom you sold into Egypt. 5 But now, do not therefore be grieved or angry with yourselves because you sold me here; for God sent me before you to preserve life. 6 For these two years the famine has been in the land, and there are still five years in which there will be neither plowing nor harvesting. 7 And God sent me before you to preserve a posterity for you in the earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance. 8 So now it was not you who sent me here, but God; and He has made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and a ruler throughout all the land of Egypt. 9 Hurry and go up to my father, and say to him, ‘Thus says your son Joseph: God has made me lord of all Egypt; come down to me, do not tarry. 10 You shall dwell in the land of Goshen, and you shall be near to me, you and your children, your children's children, your flocks and your herds, and all that you have. 11 There I will provide for you, lest you and your household, and all that you have, come to poverty; for there are still five years of famine. ' 12 And behold, your eyes and the eyes of my brother Benjamin see that it is my mouth that speaks to you. 13 So you shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all that you have seen; and you shall hurry and bring my father down here. 14 Then he fell on his brother Benjamin's neck and wept, and Benjamin wept on his neck. 15 Moreover he kissed all his brothers and wept over them, and after that his brothers talked with him.

Let us hear from God's Word. First Lesson Jeremiah 26:8-15 8 Now it happened, when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking all that the Lord had commanded him to speak to all the people, that the priests and the prophets and all the people seized him, saying, You will surely die! 9 Why have you prophesied in the name of the Lord, saying, ‘This house shall be like Shiloh, and this city shall be desolate, without an inhabitant'? And all the people were gathered against Jeremiah in the house of the Lord. 10 When the princes of Judah heard these things, they came up from the king's house to the house of the Lord and sat down in the entry of the New Gate of the Lord's house. 11 And the priests and the prophets spoke to the princes and all the people, saying, This man deserves to die! For he has prophesied against this city, as you have heard with your ears. 12 Then Jeremiah spoke to all the princes and all the people, saying: The Lord sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city with all the words that you have heard. 13 Now therefore, amend your ways and your doings, and obey the voice of the Lord your God; then the Lord will relent concerning the doom that He has pronounced against you. 14 As for me, here I am, in your hand; do with me as seems good and proper to you. 15 But know for certain that if you put me to death, you will surely bring innocent blood on yourselves, on this city, and on its inhabitants; for truly the Lord has sent me to you to speak all these words in your hearing. The Word of the Lord! Thanks be to God! Second Lesson Philippians 3:17-4:1 17 Brethren, join in following my example, and note those who so walk, as you have us for a pattern. 18 For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ: 19 whose end is destruction, whose god is their belly, and whose glory is in their shame who set their mind on earthly things. 20 For our citizenship is in heaven, from which we also eagerly wait for the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, 21 who will transform our lowly body that it may be conformed to His glorious body, according to the working by which He is able even to subdue all things to Himself. 4 Therefore, my beloved and longed-for brethren, my joy and crown, so stand fast in the Lord, beloved.

So he said, 'I will do this: I will pull down my barns and build greater, and there I will store all my crops and my goods. And I will say to my soul, ""Soul, you have many goods laid up for many years; take your ease; eat, drink, and be merry."" ' But God said to him, 'Fool! This night your soul will be required of you; then whose will those things be which you have provided?' So is he who lays up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God.""

Beloved of the Lord, for Christ's sake, all your sins are forgiven, therefore Lift up your hearts!... Sanctus How Then Shall We Live? Let us hear from God's Word - THE LORD CONSECRATES US (Please be seated) First Lesson Ezekiel 33:7-20 7 So you, son of man: I have made you a watchman for the house of Israel; therefore you shall hear a word from My mouth and warn them for Me. 8 When I say to the wicked, ‘O wicked man, you shall surely die!' and you do not speak to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood I will require at your hand. 9 Nevertheless if you warn the wicked to turn from his way, and he does not turn from his way, he shall die in his iniquity; but you have delivered your soul. 10 Therefore you, O son of man, say to the house of Israel: ‘Thus you say, If our transgressions and our sins lie upon us, and we pine away in them, how can we then live? ' 11 Say to them: ‘As I live,' says the Lord God, ‘I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and live. Turn, turn from your evil ways! For why should you die, O house of Israel?' 12 Therefore you, O son of man, say to the children of your people: ‘The righteousness of the righteous man shall not deliver him in the day of his transgression; as for the wickedness of the wicked, he shall not fall because of it in the day that he turns from his wickedness; nor shall the righteous be able to live because of his righteousness in the day that he sins.' 13 When I say to the righteous that he shall surely live, but he trusts in his own righteousness and commits iniquity, none of his righteous works shall be remembered; but because of the iniquity that he has committed, he shall die. 14 Again, when I say to the wicked, ‘You shall surely die,' if he turns from his sin and does what is lawful and right, 15 if the wicked restores the pledge, gives back what he has stolen, and walks in the statutes of life without committing iniquity, he shall surely live; he shall not die. 16 None of his sins which he has committed shall be remembered against him; he has done what is lawful and right; he shall surely live. 17 Yet the children of your people say, ‘The way of the Lord is not fair.' But it is their way which is not fair! 18 When the righteous turns from his righteousness and commits iniquity, he shall die because of it. 19 But when the wicked turns from his wickedness and does what is lawful and right, he shall live because of it. 20 Yet you say, ‘The way of the Lord is not fair.' O house of Israel, I will judge every one of you according to his own ways. The Word of the Lord! Thanks be to God! Second Lesson I Corinthians 10:1-13 10 Moreover, brethren, I do not want you to be unaware that all our fathers were under the cloud, all passed through the sea, 2 all were baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea, 3 all ate the same spiritual food, 4 and all drank the same spiritual drink. For they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them, and that Rock was Christ. 5 But with most of them God was not well pleased, for their bodies were scattered in the wilderness. 6 Now these things became our examples, to the intent that we should not lust after evil things as they also lusted. 7 And do not become idolaters as were some of them. As it is written, The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play. 8 Nor let us commit sexual immorality, as some of them did, and in one day twenty-three thousand fell; 9 nor let us tempt Christ, as some of them also tempted, and were destroyed by serpents; 10 nor complain, as some of them also complained, and were destroyed by the destroyer. 11 Now all these things happened to them as examples, and they were written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the ages have come. 12 Therefore let him who thinks he stands take heed lest he fall. 13 No temptation has overtaken you except such as is common to man; but God is faithful, who will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you are able, but with the temptation will also make the way of escape, that you may be able to bear it. The Word of the Lord! Thanks be to God! (Please stand for the Gospel Reading and the Gloria Patri) Gospel Lesson Luke 13:1-9 The Gospel of the Kingdom! Praise be to the Lord Jesus Christ!

I declare, according to the command of God, that from heaven you are released from all your sins (as Christ has promised in His Gospel), through the perfect satisfaction of the most holy passion and death of our Lord Jesus Christ.

Give us this day our daily bread, And forgive us our debts, as we forgive, our debtors. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For Thine is the Kingdom, and the Power, and the Glory. Forever and ever. Amen. CONFESSION OF SINS People of God, we need the cleansing and renewal that comes from God alone. Therefore, I invite all who are able to kneel, for a time of silent prayer and confession. We'll pray first silently, then unison. Let us pray together Almighty God, You have raised Your Son, Jesus, from death to life, and crowned Him Lord of all. We confess every way in which we have not bowed before Him, or acknowledged His rule in our lives. We confess where we have gone along with the ways of the world, and failed to give Him glory. Forgive us and raise us from sin, that we may be Your faithful people, obeying the commands of our Lord Jesus Christ, who rules the world and is Head of the Church, His Body. In His name we pray, Amen. * ASSURANCE OF FORGIVENESS Leader: Arise and hear good news . Romans 6 You have been buried with Jesus, by baptism into death, for this reason, so that just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, you also might walk in newness of life. Someone who's died has been set free from sin. We know that Christ, being raised from the dead, will never die again; death no longer has dominion over him. So you also must understand yourselves as dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus. 12 Therefore do not let sin rule in your still-mortal body; Do not let it make you obey its passions. 13 Do not make your bodily members available to sin, so that they become tools used for unrighteousness; instead, offer yourselves to God as one who's been brought from death to life, and make your bodily members available to God so that they become tools for righteousness. -- "" Almighty God, our heavenly Father, by raising His dear Son from the dead has declared to all the world that the final sacrifice has been made for sin the sacrifice of Jesus on the cross. To You who have been buried with Him in baptism; who walk after Him in new life; and who have confessed your sin today. God declares in the resurrection of Your Savior that all our sins are forgiven for Jesus' sake. Leader: Lift up your hearts! People: We lift them up to the Lord. Sanctus THE LORD CONSECRATES US (Please be seated) First Lesson Isaiah 65:17-25 For behold, I create new heavens and a new earth; And the former shall not be remembered or come to mind. 18 But be glad and rejoice forever in what I create; For behold, I create Jerusalem as a rejoicing, And her people a joy. 19 I will rejoice in Jerusalem, And joy in My people; The voice of weeping shall no longer be heard in her, Nor the voice of crying. 20 No more shall an infant from there live but a few days, Nor an old man who has not fulfilled his days; For the child shall die one hundred years old, But the sinner being one hundred years old shall be accursed. 21 They shall build houses and inhabit them; They shall plant vineyards and eat their fruit. 22 They shall not build and another inhabit; They shall not plant and another eat; For as the days of a tree, so shall be the days of My people, And My elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands. 23 They shall not labor in vain, Nor bring forth children for trouble; For they shall be the descendants of the blessed of the Lord, And their offspring with them. 24 It shall come to pass That before they call, I will answer; And while they are still speaking, I will hear. 25 The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, The lion shall eat straw like the ox, And dust shall be the serpent's food. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all My holy mountain, Says the Lord. The Word of the Lord! Thanks be to God! Second Lesson 1 Corinthians 15:19-26 19 If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men the most pitiable. 20 But now Christ is risen from the dead, and has become the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep. 21 For since by man came death, by Man also came the resurrection of the dead. 22 For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ all shall be made alive. 23 But each one in his own order: Christ the firstfruits, afterward those who are Christ's at His coming. 24 Then comes the end, when He delivers the kingdom to God the Father, when He puts an end to all rule and all authority and power. 25 For He must reign till He has put all enemies under His feet. 26 The last enemy that will be destroyed is death.

And the Lord said to Satan, ""The Lord rebuke you, Satan! The Lord who has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you! Is this not a brand plucked from the fire?"" Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and was standing before the Angel. Then He answered and spoke to those who stood before Him, saying, ""Take away the filthy garments from him."" And to him He said, ""See, I have removed your iniquity from you, and I will clothe you with rich robes."" And I said, ""Let them put a clean turban on his head."" So they put a clean turban on his head, and they put the clothes on him. And the Angel of the Lord stood by. [To all who confess their sin to God and seek His forgiveness through our great High Priest Jesus Christ, God rebukes the devil, the accuser, and plucks you as a brand from the burning, removes the filthy garments of your own righteousness, and clothes you with the rich robes of the righteousness of Christ. Beloved in the Lord, all your sins are forgiven for Jesus' sake!]. Therefore: Lift up your hearts! People: We lift them up to the Lord. THE LORD CONSECRATES US Sanctus (Please be seated) How shall we then live? Let us hear from the word of the Lord. How Shall We Then Live? First Lesson Acts 5:12-42 12 And through the hands of the apostles many signs and wonders were done among the people. And they were all with one accord in Solomon's Porch. 13 Yet none of the rest dared join them, but the people esteemed them highly. 14 And believers were increasingly added to the Lord, multitudes of both men and women, 15 so that they brought the sick out into the streets and laid them on beds and couches, that at least the shadow of Peter passing by might fall on some of them. 16 Also a multitude gathered from the surrounding cities to Jerusalem, bringing sick people and those who were tormented by unclean spirits, and they were all healed. 17 Then the high priest rose up, and all those who were with him (which is the sect of the Sadducees), and they were filled with indignation, 18 and laid their hands on the apostles and put them in the common prison. 19 But at night an angel of the Lord opened the prison doors and brought them out, and said, 20 Go, stand in the temple and speak to the people all the words of this life. 21 And when they heard that, they entered the temple early in the morning and taught. But the high priest and those with him came and called the council together, with all the elders of the children of Israel, and sent to the prison to have them brought. 22 But when the officers came and did not find them in the prison, they returned and reported, 23 saying, Indeed we found the prison shut securely, and the guards standing outside before the doors; but when we opened them, we found no one inside! 24 Now when the high priest, the captain of the temple, and the chief priests heard these things, they wondered what the outcome would be. 25 So one came and told them, saying, Look, the men whom you put in prison are standing in the temple and teaching the people! 26 Then the captain went with the officers and brought them without violence, for they feared the people, lest they should be stoned. 27 And when they had brought them, they set them before the council. And the high priest asked them, 28 saying, Did we not strictly command you not to teach in this name? And look, you have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine, and intend to bring this Man's blood on us! 29 But Peter and the other apostles answered and said: We ought to obey God rather than men. 30 The God of our fathers raised up Jesus whom you murdered by hanging on a tree. 31 Him God has exalted to His right hand to be Prince and Savior, to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins. 32 And we are His witnesses to these things, and so also is the Holy Spirit whom God has given to those who obey Him. 33 When they heard this, they were furious and plotted to kill them. 34 Then one in the council stood up, a Pharisee named Gamaliel, a teacher of the law held in respect by all the people, and commanded them to put the apostles outside for a little while. 35 And he said to them: Men of Israel, take heed to yourselves what you intend to do regarding these men. 36 For some time ago Theudas rose up, claiming to be somebody. A number of men, about four hundred, joined him. He was slain, and all who obeyed him were scattered and came to nothing. 37 After this man, Judas of Galilee rose up in the days of the census, and drew away many people after him. He also perished, and all who obeyed him were dispersed. 38 And now I say to you, keep away from these men and let them alone; for if this plan or this work is of men, it will come to nothing; 39 but if it is of God, you cannot overthrow it lest you even be found to fight against God. 40 And they agreed with him, and when they had called for the apostles and beaten them, they commanded that they should not speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go. 41 So they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for His name. 42 And daily in the temple, and in every house, they did not cease teaching and preaching Jesus as the Christ. The Word of the Lord! Thanks be to God! Revelation 1:4-18 4 John, to the seven churches which are in Asia: Grace to you and peace from Him who is and who was and who is to come, and from the seven Spirits who are before His throne, 5 and from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the firstborn from the dead, and the ruler over the kings of the earth. To Him who loved us and washed us from our sins in His own blood, 6 and has made us kings and priests to His God and Father, to Him be glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen. 7 Behold, He is coming with clouds, and every eye will see Him, even they who pierced Him. And all the tribes of the earth will mourn because of Him. Even so, Amen. 8 I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End, says the Lord, who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty. 9 I, John, both your brother and companion in the tribulation and kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ, was on the island that is called Patmos for the word of God and for the testimony of Jesus Christ. 10 I was in the Spirit on the Lord's Day, and I heard behind me a loud voice, as of a trumpet, 11 saying, I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, and, What you see, write in a book and send it to the seven churches which are in Asia: to Ephesus, to Smyrna, to Pergamos, to Thyatira, to Sardis, to Philadelphia, and to Laodicea. 12 Then I turned to see the voice that spoke with me. And having turned I saw seven golden lampstands, 13 and in the midst of the seven lampstands One like the Son of Man, clothed with a garment down to the feet and girded about the chest with a golden band. 14 His head and hair were white like wool, as white as snow, and His eyes like a flame of fire; 15 His feet were like fine brass, as if refined in a furnace, and His voice as the sound of many waters; 16 He had in His right hand seven stars, out of His mouth went a sharp two-edged sword, and His countenance was like the sun shining in its strength. 17 And when I saw Him, I fell at His feet as dead. But He laid His right hand on me, saying to me, Do not be afraid; I am the First and the Last. 18 I am He who lives, and was dead, and behold, I am alive forevermore. Amen. And I have the keys of Hades and of Death. The Word of the Lord! Thanks be to God! Second Lesson Revelation 1:4-18 The Word of the Lord! Thanks be to God!

Every branch in Me that does not bear fruit He takes away; and every branch that bears fruit He prunes, that it may bear more fruit. You are already clean because of the word which I have spoken to you. Abide in Me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, unless it abides in the vine, neither can you, unless you abide in Me. I am the vine, you are the branches. He who abides in Me, and I in him, bears much fruit; for without Me you can do nothing. Our Gracious Heavenly Father, with the presentation of our offerings we acknowledge and confess Your truth, that apart from You we can do nothing. We thank You for Your kind and bountiful provision for Your people and ask that as You continue to grant it, You would also cause us to know more fully what it is to abide in You so that as stewards of Your gifts we would be found faithful and You would reap a full harvest of good fruit by our lives.

Sanctus THE LORD CONSECRATES US (Please be seated) First Lesson Acts 9:1-22 Acts 9:1-22 9 Then Saul, still breathing threats and murder against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest 2 and asked letters from him to the synagogues of Damascus, so that if he found any who were of the Way, whether men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem. 3 As he journeyed he came near Damascus, and suddenly a light shone around him from heaven. 4 Then he fell to the ground, and heard a voice saying to him, Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me? 5 And he said, Who are You, Lord? Then the Lord said, I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting. It is hard for you to kick against the goads. 6 So he, trembling and astonished, said, Lord, what do You want me to do? Then the Lord said to him, Arise and go into the city, and you will be told what you must do. 7 And the men who journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing a voice but seeing no one. 8 Then Saul arose from the ground, and when his eyes were opened he saw no one. But they led him by the hand and brought him into Damascus. 9 And he was three days without sight, and neither ate nor drank. 10 Now there was a certain disciple at Damascus named Ananias; and to him the Lord said in a vision, Ananias. And he said, Here I am, Lord. 11 So the Lord said to him, Arise and go to the street called Straight, and inquire at the house of Judas for one called Saul of Tarsus, for behold, he is praying. 12 And in a vision he has seen a man named Ananias coming in and putting his hand on him, so that he might receive his sight. 13 Then Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard from many about this man, how much harm he has done to Your saints in Jerusalem. 14 And here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all who call on Your name. 15 But the Lord said to him, Go, for he is a chosen vessel of Mine to bear My name before Gentiles, kings, and the children of Israel. 16 For I will show him how many things he must suffer for My name's sake. 17 And Ananias went his way and entered the house; and laying his hands on him he said, Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus, who appeared to you on the road as you came, has sent me that you may receive your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit. 18 Immediately there fell from his eyes something like scales, and he received his sight at once; and he arose and was baptized. 19 So when he had received food, he was strengthened. Then Saul spent some days with the disciples at Damascus. 20 Immediately he preached the Christ in the synagogues, that He is the Son of God. 21 Then all who heard were amazed, and said, Is this not he who destroyed those who called on this name in Jerusalem, and has come here for that purpose, so that he might bring them bound to the chief priests? 22 But Saul increased all the more in strength, and confounded the Jews who dwelt in Damascus, proving that this Jesus is the Christ. The Word of the Lord! Thanks be to God! Second Lesson Revelation 5:1-14 Revelation 5 5 And I saw in the right hand of Him who sat on the throne a scroll written inside and on the back, sealed with seven seals. 2 Then I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is worthy to open the scroll and to loose its seals? 3 And no one in heaven or on the earth or under the earth was able to open the scroll, or to look at it. 4 So I wept much, because no one was found worthy to open and read the scroll, or to look at it. 5 But one of the elders said to me, Do not weep. Behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has prevailed to open the scroll and to loose its seven seals. 6 And I looked, and behold, in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures, and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb as though it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent out into all the earth. 7 Then He came and took the scroll out of the right hand of Him who sat on the throne. 8 Now when He had taken the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb, each having a harp, and golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints. 9 And they sang a new song, saying: You are worthy to take the scroll, And to open its seals; For You were slain, And have redeemed us to God by Your blood Out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation, 10 And have made us kings and priests to our God; And we shall reign on the earth. 11 Then I looked, and I heard the voice of many angels around the throne, the living creatures, and the elders; and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands, 12 saying with a loud voice: Worthy is the Lamb who was slain To receive power and riches and wisdom, And strength and honor and glory and blessing! 13 And every creature which is in heaven and on the earth and under the earth and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, I heard saying: Blessing and honor and glory and power Be to Him who sits on the throne, And to the Lamb, forever and ever! 14 Then the four living creatures said, Amen! And the twenty-four elders fell down and worshiped Him who lives forever and ever. The Word of the Lord! Thanks be to God!

First Lesson Acts 20:17-35 17 From Miletus he sent to Ephesus and called for the elders of the church. 18 And when they had come to him, he said to them: You know, from the first day that I came to Asia, in what manner I always lived among you, 19 serving the Lord with all humility, with many tears and trials which happened to me by the plotting of the Jews; 20 how I kept back nothing that was helpful, but proclaimed it to you, and taught you publicly and from house to house, 21 testifying to Jews, and also to Greeks, repentance toward God and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ. 22 And see, now I go bound in the spirit to Jerusalem, not knowing the things that will happen to me there, 23 except that the Holy Spirit testifies in every city, saying that chains and tribulations await me. 24 But none of these things move me; nor do I count my life dear to myself, so that I may finish my race with joy, and the ministry which I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify to the gospel of the grace of God. 25 And indeed, now I know that you all, among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God, will see my face no more. 26 Therefore I testify to you this day that I am innocent of the blood of all men. 27 For I have not shunned to declare to you the whole counsel of God. 28 Therefore take heed to yourselves and to all the flock, among which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to shepherd the church of God which He purchased with His own blood. 29 For I know this, that after my departure savage wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock. 30 Also from among yourselves men will rise up, speaking perverse things, to draw away the disciples after themselves. 31 Therefore watch, and remember that for three years I did not cease to warn everyone night and day with tears. 32 So now, brethren, I commend you to God and to the word of His grace, which is able to build you up and give you an inheritance among all those who are sanctified. 33 I have coveted no one's silver or gold or apparel. 34 Yes, you yourselves know that these hands have provided for my necessities, and for those who were with me. 35 I have shown you in every way, by laboring like this, that you must support the weak. And remember the words of the Lord Jesus, that He said, ‘It is more blessed to give than to receive.' The Word of the Lord! Thanks be to God! Second Lesson Revelation 7:9-17 9 After these things I looked, and behold, a great multitude which no one could number, of all nations, tribes, peoples, and tongues, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, with palm branches in their hands, 10 and crying out with a loud voice, saying, Salvation belongs to our God who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb! 11 All the angels stood around the throne and the elders and the four living creatures, and fell on their faces before the throne and worshiped God, 12 saying: Amen!

So he said to me, These are the ones who come out of the great tribulation, and washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. 15 Therefore they are before the throne of God, and serve Him day and night in His temple. And He who sits on the throne will dwell among them. 16 They shall neither hunger anymore nor thirst anymore; the sun shall not strike them, nor any heat; 17 for the Lamb who is in the midst of the throne will shepherd them and lead them to living fountains of waters.

So continuing daily with one accord in the Temple, and breaking bread from house to house, they ate their food with gladness and simplicity of heart, praising God and having favor with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily those who were being saved, Our Gracious heavenly Father, by Your Holy Spirit, work in us this same gladness and simplicity of heart that has been the mark of your people since the beginning.

Therefore Lift up your hearts! People: We lift them up to the Lord. Holy, Holy, Holy Please be seated. How Shall We Then Live? Let us hear from God's Word. First Lesson Acts 11:1-18 11 Now the apostles and brethren who were in Judea heard that the Gentiles had also received the word of God. 2 And when Peter came up to Jerusalem, those of the circumcision contended with him, 3 saying, You went in to uncircumcised men and ate with them! 4 But Peter explained it to them in order from the beginning, saying: 5 I was in the city of Joppa praying; and in a trance I saw a vision, an object descending like a great sheet, let down from heaven by four corners; and it came to me. 6 When I observed it intently and considered, I saw four-footed animals of the earth, wild beasts, creeping things, and birds of the air. 7 And I heard a voice saying to me, ‘Rise, Peter; kill and eat.' 8 But I said, ‘Not so, Lord! For nothing common or unclean has at any time entered my mouth.' 9 But the voice answered me again from heaven, ‘What God has cleansed you must not call common.' 10 Now this was done three times, and all were drawn up again into heaven. 11 At that very moment, three men stood before the house where I was, having been sent to me from Caesarea. 12 Then the Spirit told me to go with them, doubting nothing. Moreover these six brethren accompanied me, and we entered the man's house. 13 And he told us how he had seen an angel standing in his house, who said to him, ‘Send men to Joppa, and call for Simon whose surname is Peter, 14 who will tell you words by which you and all your household will be saved.' 15 And as I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell upon them, as upon us at the beginning. 16 Then I remembered the word of the Lord, how He said, ‘John indeed baptized with water, but you shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit.' 17 If therefore God gave them the same gift as He gave us when we believed on the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I that I could withstand God? 18 When they heard these things they became silent; and they glorified God, saying, Then God has also granted to the Gentiles repentance to life. The Word of the Lord! Thanks be to God! Second Lesson Revelation 21:1-7 21 Now I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away. Also there was no more sea. 2 Then I, John, saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. 3 And I heard a loud voice from heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He will dwell with them, and they shall be His people. God Himself will be with them and be their God. 4 And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes; there shall be no more death, nor sorrow, nor crying. There shall be no more pain, for the former things have passed away. 5 Then He who sat on the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And He said to me, Write, for these words are true and faithful. 6 And He said to me, It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End. I will give of the fountain of the water of life freely to him who thirsts. 7 He who overcomes shall inherit all things, and I will be his God and he shall be My son. The Word of the Lord! Thanks be to God! (Please stand for our Gospel Reading and song) Gospel Lesson John 16:12-22 The Gospel of the Kingdom! Praise be to the Lord Jesus Christ!

And with great power the apostles gave witness to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus. And great grace was upon them all. Nor was there anyone among them who lacked; for all who were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the proceeds of the things that were sold, and laid them at the apostles' feet; and they distributed to each as anyone had need.

Jn 3.16,17 * Arise and hear the good news of God's FORGIVENESS Our Lord Jesus Christ says: For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him might not perish, but have everlasting life. For God sent not His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world, through Him, might be saved. Whoever believes in Him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God. Anyone present who persists in the love of sin, and refuses to repent from his shame, though their conscience convict them, I declare to you, by God's command, that His wrath and judgment abides upon you, and that all your sins are retained in heaven, and that you can never be delivered from eternal damnation, unless and until you repent. But, to every one of you beloved brothers and sisters, who abhor your sins, and resolve daily to turn from them and to serve the Lord in true holiness and righteousness; and believing in Him for the forgiveness of your sins I declare, according to God's command, that from heaven you are released from all your sins (as Christ has promised in His Gospel), through the perfect satisfaction of the most holy passion, death, and resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ. Beloved in the Lord, your sins are forgiven, Therefore, Lift up your hearts! People: We lift them up to the Lord. Holy, Holy, Holy Please be seated. How Shall We Then Live? Let us hear from God's Word. First Lesson Acts 16:9-15 Acts 16:9-15 9 And a vision appeared to Paul in the night. A man of Macedonia stood and pleaded with him, saying, Come over to Macedonia and help us. 10 Now after he had seen the vision, immediately we sought to go to Macedonia, concluding that the Lord had called us to preach the gospel to them. 11 Therefore, sailing from Troas, we ran a straight course to Samothrace, and the next day came to Neapolis, 12 and from there to Philippi, which is the foremost city of that part of Macedonia, a colony. And we were staying in that city for some days. 13 And on the Sabbath day we went out of the city to the riverside, where prayer was customarily made; and we sat down and spoke to the women who met there. 14 Now a certain woman named Lydia heard us. She was a seller of purple from the city of Thyatira, who worshiped God. The Lord opened her heart to heed the things spoken by Paul. 15 And when she and her household were baptized, she begged us, saying, If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come to my house and stay. So she persuaded us. The Word of the Lord! Thanks be to God! Second Lesson Revelation 21:21-27 Revelation 21:9-27 9 Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls filled with the seven last plagues came to me and talked with me, saying, Come, I will show you the bride, the Lamb's wife. 10 And he carried me away in the Spirit to a great and high mountain, and showed me the great city, the holy Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God, 11 having the glory of God. Her light was like a most precious stone, like a jasper stone, clear as crystal. 12 Also she had a great and high wall with twelve gates, and twelve angels at the gates, and names written on them, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel: 13 three gates on the east, three gates on the north, three gates on the south, and three gates on the west. 14 Now the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them were the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb. 15 And he who talked with me had a gold reed to measure the city, its gates, and its wall. 16 The city is laid out as a square; its length is as great as its breadth. And he measured the city with the reed: twelve thousand furlongs. Its length, breadth, and height are equal. 17 Then he measured its wall: one hundred and forty-four cubits, according to the measure of a man, that is, of an angel. 18 The construction of its wall was of jasper; and the city was pure gold, like clear glass. 19 The foundations of the wall of the city were adorned with all kinds of precious stones: the first foundation was jasper, the second sapphire, the third chalcedony, the fourth emerald, 20 the fifth sardonyx, the sixth sardius, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth chrysoprase, the eleventh jacinth, and the twelfth amethyst. 21 The twelve gates were twelve pearls: each individual gate was of one pearl. And the street of the city was pure gold, like transparent glass. 22 But I saw no temple in it, for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are its temple. 23 The city had no need of the sun or of the moon to shine in it, for the glory of God illuminated it. The Lamb is its light. 24 And the nations of those who are saved shall walk in its light, and the kings of the earth bring their glory and honor into it. 25 Its gates shall not be shut at all by day (there shall be no night there). 26 And they shall bring the glory and the honor of the nations into it. 27 But there shall by no means enter it anything that defiles, or causes an abomination or a lie, but only those who are written in the Lamb's Book of Life.

21,2022-05-29,"SEVENTH SUNDAY OF EASTER May 29, 2022 Dr. Rasmussen the elders assemble in the Robe room in the back at about 10:10 to prep, pray, mic and/or robe up. Feel free to robe or not it's up to you. After the robe room, make your way to the front and be seated in one of the seats behind the pulpit while the pianist finishes the prelude music. At this point, our Deacon Dr Dave Goetsch will begin announcements. You remain seated until after the gospel reading. about 15 mins if I had to guess. Gary, when announcements are finished, go to the pulpit, and begin with the call to worship below. The people will rise when you call them to rise in a minute. The brightly highlighted parts are your speaking lines. The lightly highlighted parts [like this] are my directions. Hear this call to worship from Hebrews 4: Because we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession. 15 For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who in every respect has been tempted as we are, yet without sin. 16 Let us then with confidence draw near to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in our time of need. Christ is risen! He is risen indeed! Christ is risen from the dead. Alleluia! Thanks be to God who has given us victory through the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen! Christ, our Passover is sacrificed for us. Therefore, let us keep the feast. Alleluia! The Lord be with you! The Lord bless you! Amen! Our Entrance Psalm today is: Psalm 133 Behold, how good and pleasant it is when brothers dwell in unity! It is like the precious oil on the head, running down on the beard, on the beard of Aaron, running down on the collar of his robes! It is like the dew of Hermon, which falls on the mountains of Zion! For there the Lord has commanded the blessing, life for evermore. Pause - the pianist will begin to play - Remain standing at pulpit and start off the singing for the opening hymn below. The congregation knows to join in and sing: After the song, still standing at the pulpit, continue immediately into opening prayer of adoration below: Almighty and eternal God, We praise You for Your Son, our Savior, Who was taken up into Heaven Where He is even now at Your right hand in eternal glory, Interceding for us acting as our Advocate. We praise You for the Spirit Who abides in us as our Guide and Defender here. For You are the Great King over all the earth! You reign over the nations! You sit on the throne! And all the princes of the peoples gather to exalt You! Now hear us as we sing the prayer Your Son has given us: Pause - the pianist will begin to play - Remain standing at pulpit and start off the singing the Lord's prayer. The congregation knows to join in and sing: Our Father, who art in Heaven, Hallowed be Thy Name. Thy Kingdom Come. Thy will be done, on earth as it is in Heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, And forgive us our debts, as we forgive, our debtors. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For Thine is the Kingdom, and the Power, and the Glory. Forever and ever. Amen. After the song. Introduce the time of confession by saying: Saints of God, we are in need of cleansing and renewal. Let us call upon the mercy of our heavenly Father. Let us kneel and confess our sins together, in humble reliance upon the grace of God, first silently, then together. [kneel and pause for 20 seconds] Then, still kneeling, loudly say: Let us pray together! Almighty God, You have raised Your Son, Jesus, from death to life, and crowned Him Lord of all. We confess every way in which we have not bowed before Him, or acknowledged His rule in our lives. We confess where we have gone along with the ways of the world, and failed to give Him glory. Forgive us and raise us from sin, that we may be Your faithful people, obeying the commands of our Lord Jesus Christ, who rules the world and is Head of the Church, His Body. In His name we pray, Amen. Arise and hear the good news of God's FORGIVENESS ROMANS 8:32-34 He who did not spare His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not with Him also freely give us all things? Who shall bring a charge against God's elect? It is God who justifies. Who is he who condemns? It is Christ Jesus who died, yes, who was raised from the dead, Who is at the right hand of God, who indeed intercedes for us. Our heavenly father, in His great mercy, did not spare His own Son, but has delivered Him up for us all. He does not condemn you, but for Christ's sake forgives all your sins. Therefore Lift up your hearts! We lift them up to the Lord! When the song is over say : Please be seated. Our First Lesson today is from Acts 1:12-26 12 Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, a Sabbath day's journey. 13 And when they had entered, they went up into the upper room where they were staying: Peter, James, John, and Andrew; Philip and Thomas; Bartholomew and Matthew; James the son of Alphaeus and Simon the Zealot; and Judas the son of James. 14 These all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with His brothers. 15 And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples (altogether the number of names was about a hundred and twenty), and said, 16 Men and brethren, this Scripture had to be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit spoke before by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who became a guide to those who arrested Jesus; 17 for he was numbered with us and obtained a part in this ministry. 18 (Now this man purchased a field with the wages of iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his entrails gushed out. 19 And it became known to all those dwelling in Jerusalem; so that field is called in their own language, Akel Dama, that is, Field of Blood.) 20 For it is written in the Book of Psalms: ‘Let his dwelling place be desolate, And let no one live in it'; and, ‘Let another take his office.' 21 Therefore, of these men who have accompanied us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us, 22 beginning from the baptism of John to that day when He was taken up from us, one of these must become a witness with us of His resurrection. 23 And they proposed two: Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias. 24 And they prayed and said, You, O Lord, who know the hearts of all, show which of these two You have chosen 25 to take part in this ministry and apostleship from which Judas by transgression fell, that he might go to his own place. 26 And they cast their lots, and the lot fell on Matthias. And he was numbered with the eleven apostles. The Word of the Lord! Thanks be to God! Our Epistle Lesson is from Revelation 22:1-20 22 And he showed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding from the throne of God and of the Lamb. 2 In the middle of its street, and on either side of the river, was the tree of life, which bore twelve fruits, each tree yielding its fruit every month. The leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations. 3 And there shall be no more curse, but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it, and His servants shall serve Him. 4 They shall see His face, and His name shall be on their foreheads. 5 There shall be no night there: They need no lamp nor light of the sun, for the Lord God gives them light. And they shall reign forever and ever. 6 Then he said to me, These words are faithful and true. And the Lord God of the holy prophets sent His angel to show His servants the things which must shortly take place. 7 Behold, I am coming quickly! Blessed is he who keeps the words of the prophecy of this book. 8 Now I, John, saw and heard these things. And when I heard and saw, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel who showed me these things. 9 Then he said to me, See that you do not do that. For I am your fellow servant, and of your brethren the prophets, and of those who keep the words of this book. Worship God. 10 And he said to me, Do not seal the words of the prophecy of this book, for the time is at hand. 11 He who is unjust, let him be unjust still; he who is filthy, let him be filthy still; he who is righteous, let him be righteous still; he who is holy, let him be holy still. 12 And behold, I am coming quickly, and My reward is with Me, to give to every one according to his work. 13 I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End, the First and the Last. 14 Blessed are those who do His commandments, that they may have the right to the tree of life, and may enter through the gates into the city. 15 But outside are dogs and sorcerers and sexually immoral and murderers and idolaters, and whoever loves and practices a lie. 16 I, Jesus, have sent My angel to testify to you these things in the churches. I am the Root and the Offspring of David, the Bright and Morning Star. 17 And the Spirit and the bride say, Come! And let him who hears say, Come! And let him who thirsts come. Whoever desires, let him take the water of life freely. 18 For I testify to everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: If anyone adds to these things, God will add to him the plagues that are written in this book; 19 and if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part from the Book of Life, from the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book. 20 He who testifies to these things says, Surely I am coming quickly. Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus! The Word of the Lord! Thanks be to God! (Please rise for our Gospel Reading and the Gloria Patri) Today's Gospel Lesson is Matthew 5:13 Then walk down and read from the floor podium Bible The Gospel of the Kingdom!

Gary - With the amen resume your place behind the pulpit and sing during the offertory. Offertory Now Let the Vault of Heav'n Resound When the song concludes, be seated behind the pulpit during the diaconal prayer [below]. One of the deacons will pray it. Be ready to stand when he finishes with amen. Offertory Now Let the Vault of Heaven Resound Presentation of Tithes and Offering May 29th ACTS 9:36-39 -- At Joppa there was a certain disciple named Tabitha, which is translated Dorcas. This woman was full of good works and charitable deeds which she did. But it happened in those days that she became sick and died. When they had washed her, they laid her in an upper room. And since Lydda was near Joppa, and the disciples had heard that Peter was there, they sent two men to him, imploring him not to delay in coming to them. Then Peter arose and went with them. When he had come, they brought him to the upper room. And all the widows stood by him weeping, showing the tunics and garments which Dorcas had made while she was with them. Our Gracious Heavenly Father, receive, bless, and multiply these offerings we bring to You today. Grant us the grace of Your Holy Spirit to lead lives full of good works and deeds of charity, so that, like Tabitha, even in death we may leave tangible evidence of Your goodness in the fruit of our life's labors, through Jesus Christ Your Son. AMEN. With his amen, the deacon will be reseated. At this point, Elder Mike Ruff, rise and go back to the pulpit. Then say: Rise now and pray together with me for the Church and the World!

Then read the following]: I John 1:9-10 In this the love of God was manifested toward us, that God has sent His only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through Him. In this is love, not that we loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son to be the propitiation for our sins. Let us pray: Most gracious God! As Your Son once offered up His body and blood on the cross for the remission of our sins, and has given his body and blood to us as our food and drink unto life eternal: So give us grace, with sincere hearts and fervent desires, to receive this great blessing from His hands so that we would no longer to live for ourselves in sin; but may Christ live in us, and lead us to the life that is holy, blessed, and faithful forever.

Heavenly Father, make us true partakers of the new and everlasting covenant, and fit us to now celebrate the blessed memorial of Your Son. Bless and grow us by the contemplation of His love, and show us the benefits of His death; that receiving fresh increase of strength in Your faith and in all good works, we may with greater confidence cry to You our Father, and evermore rejoice in You; We thank You, Through Jesus Christ, our Redeemer, Who shed His blood that we might live and ascended to Your side that we may always receive our Help from You.

Let us call upon the mercy of our heavenly Father. Let us kneel and confess our sins together, in humble reliance upon the grace of God, first silently, then together. (Please Kneel) Let us pray together Lord God, eternal and almighty Father: We acknowledge before your holy majesty that we are poor sinners, conceived and born in guilt and in corruption, prone to do evil, unable of our own power to do good. Because of our sin, we endlessly violate your holy commandments. But, O Lord, with heartfelt sorrow we repent and turn away from all our offenses; asking for your grace to relieve our distress. Have compassion on us, most gracious God, Father of mercies, for the sake of your son Jesus Christ our Lord. And in removing our guilt, also grant us daily increase of the grace of your Holy Spirit, and produce in us the fruits of holiness and of righteousness pleasing in your sight: Through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen. (Please Stand) Arise and hear the good news of God's forgiveness! (Gal 4) When the fullness of time had come, God sent forth his Son, born of woman, born under the law, 5 to redeem those who were under the law, so that we might receive adoption as sons. 6 And because you are sons, God has sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, Abba! Father! 7 So you are no longer a slave, but a son, and if a son, then an heir through God. Our heavenly father, in His great mercy, first sent His own Son, and then sent His Spirit, so that we would no longer be slaves to sin and death, but sons of God and heirs together with Christ. To this the scars of Christ remain as a memorial in Heaven, and the Spirit of Christ remains in us as a Helper and Living Memorial on earth. So remember now, and rejoice in that the Father, for Christ's sake, has forgiven your sins. Therefore Lift up your hearts! People: We lift them up to the Lord. Sanctus THE LORD CONSECRATES US Please be seated. First Lesson Genesis 11:1-9 11 Now the whole earth had one language and one speech. 2 And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar, and they dwelt there. 3 Then they said to one another, Come, let us make bricks and bake them thoroughly. They had brick for stone, and they had asphalt for mortar. 4 And they said, Come, let us build ourselves a city, and a tower whose top is in the heavens; let us make a name for ourselves, lest we be scattered abroad over the face of the whole earth. 5 But the Lord came down to see the city and the tower which the sons of men had built. 6 And the Lord said, Indeed the people are one and they all have one language, and this is what they begin to do; now nothing that they propose to do will be withheld from them. 7 Come, let Us go down and there confuse their language, that they may not understand one another's speech. 8 So the Lord scattered them abroad from there over the face of all the earth, and they ceased building the city. 9 Therefore its name is called Babel, because there the Lord confused the language of all the earth; and from there the Lord scattered them abroad over the face of all the earth. The Word of the Lord! Thanks be to God! Second Lesson Acts 2:1-21 2 When the Day of Pentecost had fully come, they were all with one accord in one place. 2 And suddenly there came a sound from heaven, as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting. 3 Then there appeared to them divided tongues, as of fire, and one sat upon each of them. 4 And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance. 5 And there were dwelling in Jerusalem Jews, devout men, from every nation under heaven. 6 And when this sound occurred, the multitude came together, and were confused, because everyone heard them speak in his own language. 7 Then they were all amazed and marveled, saying to one another, Look, are not all these who speak Galileans? 8 And how is it that we hear, each in our own language in which we were born? 9 Parthians and Medes and Elamites, those dwelling in Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia, 10 Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya adjoining Cyrene, visitors from Rome, both Jews and proselytes, 11 Cretans and Arabs we hear them speaking in our own tongues the wonderful works of God. 12 So they were all amazed and perplexed, saying to one another, Whatever could this mean? 13 Others mocking said, They are full of new wine. 14 But Peter, standing up with the eleven, raised his voice and said to them, Men of Judea and all who dwell in Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and heed my words. 15 For these are not drunk, as you suppose, since it is only the third hour of the day. 16 But this is what was spoken by the prophet Joel: 17 ‘And it shall come to pass in the last days, says God, That I will pour out of My Spirit on all flesh; Your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, Your young men shall see visions, Your old men shall dream dreams. 18 And on My menservants and on My maidservants I will pour out My Spirit in those days; And they shall prophesy. 19 I will show wonders in heaven above And signs in the earth beneath: Blood and fire and vapor of smoke. 20 The sun shall be turned into darkness, And the moon into blood, Before the coming of the great and awesome day of the Lord. 21 And it shall come to pass That whoever calls on the name of the Lord Shall be saved.' The Word of the Lord! Thanks be to God! (Now rise for our Gospel Reading and Song) Gospel Lesson John 14:23-31 The Gospel of the Kingdom! Praise be to the Lord Jesus Christ!

And this stone which I have set as a pillar shall be God's house, and of all that You give me I will surely give a tenth to You.""

THE LORD CONSECRATES US (Please be seated) How shall we then live? Let us hear from God's Word: First Lesson Proverbs 8:12-31 I, wisdom, dwell with prudence, And find out knowledge and discretion. 13 The fear of the Lord is to hate evil; Pride and arrogance and the evil way And the perverse mouth I hate. 14 Counsel is mine, and sound wisdom; I am understanding, I have strength. 15 By me kings reign, And rulers decree justice. 16 By me princes rule, and nobles, All the judges of the earth. 17 I love those who love me, And those who seek me diligently will find me. 18 Riches and honor are with me, Enduring riches and righteousness. 19 My fruit is better than gold, yes, than fine gold, And my revenue than choice silver. 20 I traverse the way of righteousness, In the midst of the paths of justice, 21 That I may cause those who love me to inherit wealth, That I may fill their treasuries. 22 The Lord possessed me at the beginning of His way, Before His works of old. 23 I have been established from everlasting, From the beginning, before there was ever an earth. 24 When there were no depths I was brought forth, When there were no fountains abounding with water. 25 Before the mountains were settled, Before the hills, I was brought forth; 26 While as yet He had not made the earth or the fields, Or the primal dust of the world. 27 When He prepared the heavens, I was there, When He drew a circle on the face of the deep, 28 When He established the clouds above, When He strengthened the fountains of the deep, 29 When He assigned to the sea its limit, So that the waters would not transgress His command, When He marked out the foundations of the earth, 30 Then I was beside Him as a master craftsman; And I was daily His delight, Rejoicing always before Him, 31 Rejoicing in His inhabited world, And my delight was with the sons of men. The Word of the Lord! Thanks be to God! Second Lesson Galatians 1.1-10 1 Paul, an apostle (not from men nor through man, but through Jesus Christ and God the Father who raised Him from the dead), 2 and all the brethren who are with me, To the churches of Galatia: 3 Grace to you and peace from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ, 4 who gave Himself for our sins, that He might deliver us from this present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father, 5 to whom be glory forever and ever. Amen. 6 I marvel that you are turning away so soon from Him who called you in the grace of Christ, to a different gospel, 7 which is not another; but there are some who trouble you and want to pervert the gospel of Christ. 8 But even if we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel to you than what we have preached to you, let him be accursed. 9 As we have said before, so now I say again, if anyone preaches any other gospel to you than what you have received, let him be accursed. 10 For do I now persuade men, or God? Or do I seek to please men? For if I still pleased men, I would not be a bondservant of Christ. The Word of the Lord! Thanks be to God!

(Please be seated) Preaching of the Word Pastor Ben Rossell Prayer of Consecration THE LORD COLLECTS OUR GIFTS Offertory How Sweet and Awful is the Place Presentation of Tithes and Offerings June 26- EXODUS 36: 4-7 -- So the children of Israel continued bringing to Moses freewill offerings every morning. Then all the craftsmen who were doing all the work of the sanctuary came, each from the work he was doing, and they spoke to Moses, saying, ""The people bring much more than enough for the service of the work which the Lord commanded us to do."" So Moses gave a commandment, and they caused it to be proclaimed throughout the camp, saying, ""Let neither man nor woman do any more work for the offering of the sanctuary."" And the people were restrained from bringing, for the material they had was sufficient for all the work to be done -- indeed too much. Our Gracious Heavenly Father, by Your Holy Spirit, grant Your Church true grace and devotion that She may support Your work with sacrificial abundance, as the people of Israel gave for the Tabernacle in the wilderness.

Then you shall feed; On her sides shall you be carried, And be dandled on her knees. 13 As one whom his mother comforts, So I will comfort you; And you shall be comforted in Jerusalem. 14 When you see this, your heart shall rejoice, And your bones shall flourish like grass; The hand of the Lord shall be known to His servants, And His indignation to His enemies. The Word of the Lord! Thanks be to God! Second Lesson Galatians 2:11-21 11 Now when Peter had come to Antioch, I withstood him to his face, because he was to be blamed; 12 for before certain men came from James, he would eat with the Gentiles; but when they came, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing those who were of the circumcision. 13 And the rest of the Jews also played the hypocrite with him, so that even Barnabas was carried away with their hypocrisy. 14 But when I saw that they were not straightforward about the truth of the gospel, I said to Peter before them all, If you, being a Jew, live in the manner of Gentiles and not as the Jews, why do you compel Gentiles to live as Jews? 15 We who are Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles, 16 knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law but by faith in Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Christ Jesus, that we might be justified by faith in Christ and not by the works of the law; for by the works of the law no flesh shall be justified. 17 But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves also are found sinners, is Christ therefore a minister of sin? Certainly not! 18 For if I build again those things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor. 19 For I through the law died to the law that I might live to God. 20 I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me. 21 I do not set aside the grace of God; for if righteousness comes through the law, then Christ died in vain.

IN THE DAY OF TROUBLE THE LORD DELIVERS HIM; the Lord protects him and keeps him alive; he is called blessed in the land; YOU DO NOT GIVE HIM UP TO THE WILL OF HIS ENEMIES. The Lord sustains him on his sickbed; IN HIS ILLNESS YOU RESTORE HIM TO FULL HEALTH. As for me, I said, O Lord, be gracious to me; heal me, for I have sinned against you! MY ENEMIES SAY OF ME IN MALICE, WHEN WILL HE DIE AND HIS NAME PERISH? And when one comes to see me, he utters empty words, WHILE HIS HEART GATHERS INIQUITY; WHEN HE GOES OUT, HE TELLS IT ABROAD. All who hate me whisper together about me; they imagine the worst for me. THEY SAY, A DEADLY THING IS POURED OUT ON HIM; HE WILL NOT RISE AGAIN FROM WHERE HE LIES. Even my close friend in whom I trusted, who ate my bread, has lifted his heel against me. BUT YOU, O LORD, BE GRACIOUS TO ME, AND RAISE ME UP, THAT I MAY REPAY THEM! By this I know that you delight in me: my enemy will not shout in triumph over me. BUT YOU HAVE UPHELD ME BECAUSE OF MY INTEGRITY, AND SET ME IN YOUR PRESENCE FOREVER. Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, FROM EVERLASTING TO EVERLASTING. Entrance Hymn I Waited for the Lord (Psalm 40) *Prayer of Adoration and Lord's Prayer Praise waits for You among Your people, Heavenly Father, and we are glad to bring it along with our offerings and ourselves. We rejoice to gather before You together with all Your people throughout all the world. Truly to You all flesh shall come. How blessed is anyone You choose and cause to approach Yourself. We praise You for calling us to dwell in Your courts that we might be satisfied with the goodness of Your Son, Jesus our Lord, Who is the confidence of all the ends of the earth. Now hear us as we sing the prayer He has taught us:.. The Lord's Prayer (arr. Nikolai Kedrov) Our Father, who art in Heaven, Hallowed be Thy Name. Thy Kingdom Come. Thy will be done, on earth as it is in Heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, And forgive us our debts, as we forgive, our debtors. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For Thine is the Kingdom, and the Power, and the Glory. Forever and ever. Amen. THE LORD CLEANSES US Saints of God, we are in need of cleansing and renewal. Let us call upon the mercy of our heavenly Father. Let us kneel and confess our sins together, in humble reliance upon the grace of God, first silently, then together. Let us pray together BULLETIN Arise! and hear the good news of God's forgiveness! [The Lord said to Israel]: I will pass through the land of Egypt on that night, and will strike all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment: I am the Lord. Now the blood shall be a sign for you on the houses where you are. And when I see the blood, I will pass over you; and the plague shall not be on you to destroy you when I strike the land of Egypt . [To you, covenant people, whose homes are marked by the blood of the Lamb, and whose very bodies are marked by the water of baptism, God declares that in Christ - your sins are forgiven and that the righteous judgment which falls on the wicked will not fall on you]. Lift up your hearts! We lift them up to the Lord! Please be seated. How Shall We Then Live? Let us hear from God's Word. First Lesson Leviticus 19:9-18 9 ‘When you reap the harvest of your land, you shall not wholly reap the corners of your field, nor shall you gather the gleanings of your harvest. 10 And you shall not glean your vineyard, nor shall you gather every grape of your vineyard; you shall leave them for the poor and the stranger: I am the Lord your God. 11 ‘You shall not steal, nor deal falsely, nor lie to one another. 12 And you shall not swear by My name falsely, nor shall you profane the name of your God: I am the Lord. 13 ‘You shall not cheat your neighbor, nor rob him. The wages of him who is hired shall not remain with you all night until morning. 14 You shall not curse the deaf, nor put a stumbling block before the blind, but shall fear your God: I am the Lord. 15 ‘You shall do no injustice in judgment. You shall not be partial to the poor, nor honor the person of the mighty. In righteousness you shall judge your neighbor. 16 You shall not go about as a talebearer among your people; nor shall you take a stand against the life of your neighbor: I am the Lord. 17 ‘You shall not hate your brother in your heart. You shall surely [a]rebuke your neighbor, and not bear sin because of him. 18 You shall not take vengeance, nor bear any grudge against the children of your people, but you shall love your neighbor as yourself: I am the Lord. The Word of the Lord! Thanks be to God! Second Lesson Galatians 3.1-14 O foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you that you should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was clearly portrayed among you as crucified? 2 This only I want to learn from you: Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith? 3 Are you so foolish? Having begun in the Spirit, are you now being made perfect by the flesh? 4 Have you suffered so many things in vain if indeed it was in vain? 5 Therefore He who supplies the Spirit to you and works miracles among you, does He do it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith? 6 just as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness. 7 Therefore know that only those who are of faith are sons of Abraham. 8 And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel to Abraham beforehand, saying, In you all the nations shall be blessed. 9 So then those who are of faith are blessed with believing Abraham. 10 For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse; for it is written, Cursed is everyone who does not continue in all things which are written in the book of the law, to do them. 11 But that no one is justified by the law in the sight of God is evident, for the just shall live by faith. 12 Yet the law is not of faith, but the man who does them shall live by them. 13 Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us (for it is written, Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree), 14 that the blessing of Abraham might come upon the Gentiles in Christ Jesus, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith. The Word of the Lord! Thanks be to God! (Now RISE for our Gospel Reading and song) Gospel Lesson Luke 10:25-37 The Gospel of the Kingdom! Praise be to the Lord Jesus Christ!

Do not hide Your face from me; DO NOT TURN YOUR SERVANT AWAY IN ANGER; You have been my help; DO NOT LEAVE ME NOR FORSAKE ME, O GOD OF MY SALVATION. When my father and my mother forsake me, THEN THE LORD WILL TAKE CARE OF ME. Teach me Your way, O Lord, AND LEAD ME IN A SMOOTH PATH, BECAUSE OF MY ENEMIES. Do not deliver me to the will of my adversaries; FALSE WITNESSES HAVE RISEN AGAINST ME, AND SUCH AS BREATHE OUT VIOLENCE.

Entrance Hymn Leave Me Not, Nor Forsake O God Let us pray: We Praise You our God, for Your goodness, mercy, and wisdom. You reject the evil and cut them off, But turn Your eyes and ears to the righteous, and save them out of all their troubles. You condemn the wicked, but always redeem the souls of Your servants. Yes, You turn and come near to the humble-hearted and repentant, Just as You did Your Righteous Son, in all His afflictions, While His very flesh was being torn, You guarded each of His bones so that not one was broken. So guard and be with us and hear us now as we sing together the prayer our Lord has given us Our Father, who art in Heaven, Hallowed be Thy Name. Thy Kingdom Come. Thy will be done, on earth as it is in Heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, And forgive us our debts, as we forgive, our debtors. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For Thine is the Kingdom, and the Power, and the Glory. Forever and ever. Amen. Saints of God, we are in need of cleansing and renewal. Let us call upon the mercy of our heavenly Father. Let us kneel and confess our sins together, in humble reliance upon the grace of God, first silently for a moment, and then aloud together with our corporate prayer of confession printed in your bulletin Let us pray together Most merciful God, we confess that we have sinned against You in thought, word, and deed, by what we have done and by what we have left undone. We have not loved You with our whole heart; we have not loved our neighbor as ourselves. For the sake of Your Son, Jesus Christ, have mercy on us. Forgive us, renew us, and lead us, so that we may delight in Your will and walk in Your ways, to the glory of Your holy name. Amen. Arise! and hear the good news of God's forgiveness from Psalm 130 Out of the depths have I cried to You, O Lord; Lord hear my voice! Let Your ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications. If You, Lord, should mark iniquities, O Lord, who could stand? But there is forgiveness with You, that You may be feared. I wait for the Lord, my soul waits, and in His word do I hope. My soul waits for the Lord more than watchmen for the morning--more than watchmen for the morning. O Israel, hope in the Lord; for with the Lord is steadfast love, and with Him is plenteous redemption. And He shall redeem Israel from all his iniquities. [To you who have confessed your sin to God, seeking His forgiveness, to you who have cried to the Lord out of the depths, who wait for the Lord more than watchmen for the morning, God declares His steadfast love and plenteous redemption. There is forgiveness with God, that He may be feared. For Christ's sake, our merciful God forgives all our sin]. Therefore, Lift up your hearts! We lift them up to the Lord! Please be seated. First Lesson Genesis 18:1-14 18 Then the Lord appeared to him by the terebinth trees of Mamre, as he was sitting in the tent door in the heat of the day. 2 So he lifted his eyes and looked, and behold, three men were standing by him; and when he saw them, he ran from the tent door to meet them, and bowed himself to the ground, 3 and said, My Lord, if I have now found favor in Your sight, do not pass on by Your servant. 4 Please let a little water be brought, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree. 5 And I will bring a morsel of bread, that you may refresh your hearts. After that you may pass by, inasmuch as you have come to your servant. They said, Do as you have said. 6 So Abraham hurried into the tent to Sarah and said, Quickly, make ready three measures of fine meal; knead it and make cakes. 7 And Abraham ran to the herd, took a tender and good calf, gave it to a young man, and he hastened to prepare it. 8 So he took butter and milk and the calf which he had prepared, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree as they ate. 9 Then they said to him, Where is Sarah your wife? So he said, Here, in the tent. 10 And He said, I will certainly return to you according to the time of life, and behold, Sarah your wife shall have a son. (Sarah was listening in the tent door which was behind him.) 11 Now Abraham and Sarah were old, well advanced in age; and Sarah had passed the age of childbearing. 12 Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I have grown old, shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also? 13 And the Lord said to Abraham, Why did Sarah laugh, saying, ‘Shall I surely bear a child, since I am old?' 14 Is anything too hard for the Lord? At the appointed time I will return to you, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son. The Word of the Lord! Thanks be to God! Second Lesson Galatians 3.13-29 13 Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us (for it is written, Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree), 14 that the blessing of Abraham might come upon the Gentiles in Christ Jesus, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith. 15 Brethren, I speak in the manner of men: Though it is only a man's covenant, yet if it is confirmed, no one annuls or adds to it. 16 Now to Abraham and his Seed were the promises made. He does not say, And to seeds, as of many, but as of one, And to your Seed, who is Christ. 17 And this I say, that the law, which was four hundred and thirty years later, cannot annul the covenant that was confirmed before by God in Christ, that it should make the promise of no effect. 18 For if the inheritance is of the law, it is no longer of promise; but God gave it to Abraham by promise. 19 What purpose then does the law serve? It was added because of transgressions, till the Seed should come to whom the promise was made; and it was appointed through angels by the hand of a mediator. 20 Now a mediator does not mediate for one only, but God is one. 21 Is the law then against the promises of God? Certainly not! For if there had been a law given which could have given life, truly righteousness would have been by the law. 22 But the Scripture has confined all under sin, that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe. 23 But before faith came, we were kept under guard by the law, kept for the faith which would afterward be revealed. 24 Therefore the law was our tutor to bring us to Christ, that we might be justified by faith. 25 But after faith has come, we are no longer under a tutor. 26 For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus. 27 For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ. 28 There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus. 29 And if you are Christ's, then you are Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise. The Word of the Lord! Thanks be to God! (Now RISE for our Gospel Reading and song) Gospel Lesson Luke 10:38-42 The Gospel of the Kingdom! Praise be to the Lord Jesus Christ!

I believe in one God: the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth, and of all things visible and invisible; And in one Lord, Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son of God, begotten of His Father before all worlds, God of God, Light of Light, very God of very God, begotten, not made, being of one substance with the Father; by Whom all things were made; Who for us men, and for our salvation, came down from Heaven, and was incarnate by the Holy Ghost of the virgin, Mary, and was made man; and was crucified also for us under Pontius Pilate; He suffered, and was buried, and the third day He rose again according to the Scriptures; and ascended into Heaven, and sitteth at the right hand of the Father; and He shall come again with glory to judge both the quick and the dead; Whose kingdom shall have no end.

And we ask that in Your fatherly goodness, You will mercifully accept this our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving; most humbly beseeching You to grant that, by the merits of death of your son Jesus Christ, and through faith in His blood, we and all Your whole Church, may obtain remission of our sins, and all other benefits of His passion. And here we offer to You, O Lord, ourselves, our souls and bodies, to be a reasonable, holy , and living sacrifice to you. Through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen. Holy Scripture says that our Lord Jesus on the same night in which He was betrayed took bread And when He had blessed the bread, He broke it and gave it to His disciples saying: ""Take, eat; this is My body which is broken for you; do this in remembrance of Me.""

Hear now God's assurance of forgiveness 1 Tim 1.15- This is a trustworthy saying, worthy of full acceptance: Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am the worst. 16But for this very reason I was shown mercy, so that in me, the worst of sinners, Christ Jesus might display His perfect patience, as an example to those who would believe in Him for eternal life. This saying is true and we should believe it: that Christ Jesus came into the world to rescue sinners. He himself bore our sins in his body on the cross, that we might be dead to sin and alive to all that is good. To You who repent and believe in Him, I proclaim to you the forgiveness of all your sins, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. therefore Lift up your hearts! We lift them up to the Lord! Please be seated. How Shall We Then Live? Let us hear from God's Word. First Lesson Genesis 18:17-33 17 And the Lord said, Shall I hide from Abraham what I am doing, 18 since Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him? 19 For I have known him, in order that he may command his children and his household after him, that they keep the way of the Lord, to do righteousness and justice, that the Lord may bring to Abraham what He has spoken to him. 20 And the Lord said, Because the outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grave, 21 I will go down now and see whether they have done altogether according to the outcry against it that has come to Me; and if not, I will know. 22 Then the men turned away from there and went toward Sodom, but Abraham still stood before the Lord. 23 And Abraham came near and said, Would You also destroy the righteous with the wicked? 24 Suppose there were fifty righteous within the city; would You also destroy the place and not spare it for the fifty righteous that were in it? 25 Far be it from You to do such a thing as this, to slay the righteous with the wicked, so that the righteous should be as the wicked; far be it from You! Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right? 26 So the Lord said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes. 27 Then Abraham answered and said, Indeed now, I who am but dust and ashes have taken it upon myself to speak to the Lord: 28 Suppose there were five less than the fifty righteous; would You destroy all of the city for lack of five? So He said, If I find there forty-five, I will not destroy it. 29 And he spoke to Him yet again and said, Suppose there should be forty found there? So He said, I will not do it for the sake of forty. 30 Then he said, Let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak: Suppose thirty should be found there? So He said, I will not do it if I find thirty there. 31 And he said, Indeed now, I have taken it upon myself to speak to the Lord: Suppose twenty should be found there? So He said, I will not destroy it for the sake of twenty. 32 Then he said, Let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak but once more: Suppose ten should be found there? And He said, I will not destroy it for the sake of ten. 33 So the Lord went His way as soon as He had finished speaking with Abraham; and Abraham returned to his place. The Word of the Lord! Thanks be to God! Second Lesson Galatians 4.1-20 4 Now I say that the heir, as long as he is a child, does not differ at all from a slave, though he is master of all, 2 but is under guardians and stewards until the time appointed by the father. 3 Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world. 4 But when the fullness of the time had come, God sent forth His Son, born of a woman, born under the law, 5 to redeem those who were under the law, that we might receive the adoption as sons. 6 And because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into your hearts, crying out, Abba, Father! 7 Therefore you are no longer a slave but a son, and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ. 8 But then, indeed, when you did not know God, you served those which by nature are not gods. 9 But now after you have known God, or rather are known by God, how is it that you turn again to the weak and beggarly elements, to which you desire again to be in bondage? 10 You observe days and months and seasons and years. 11 I am afraid for you, lest I have labored for you in vain. 12 Brethren, I urge you to become like me, for I became like you. You have not injured me at all. 13 You know that because of physical infirmity I preached the gospel to you at the first. 14 And my trial which was in my flesh you did not despise or reject, but you received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus. 15 [z]What then was the blessing you enjoyed? For I bear you witness that, if possible, you would have plucked out your own eyes and given them to me. 16 Have I therefore become your enemy because I tell you the truth? 17 They zealously court you, but for no good; yes, they want to exclude you, that you may be zealous for them. 18 But it is good to be zealous in a good thing always, and not only when I am present with you. 19 My little children, for whom I labor in birth again until Christ is formed in you, 20 I would like to be present with you now and to change my tone; for I have doubts about you.

Forgive us, renew us, and lead us, so that we may delight in Your will and walk in Your ways, to the glory of Your holy name. Amen. Arise and hear the good news of God's forgiveness! Hear now God's assurance of forgiveness Exodus 12:12-13 [The Lord said to Israel]: I will pass through the land of Egypt on that night, and will strike all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment: I am the Lord. Now the blood shall be a sign for you on the houses where you are. And when I see the blood, I will pass over you; and the plague shall not be on you to destroy you when I strike the land of Egypt . [To you, covenant people, whose homes are marked by the blood of the Lamb, and whose very bodies are marked by the water of baptism, God declares that your sins are forgiven and that the righteous judgment which falls on the wicked will not fall on you]. Therefore Lift up your hearts! We lift them up to the Lord! Please be seated. How Shall We Then Live? Let us hear from God's Word. First Lesson Ecclesiastes 2:18-26 18 Then I hated all my labor in which I had toiled under the sun, because I must leave it to the man who will come after me. 19 And who knows whether he will be wise or a fool? Yet he will rule over all my labor in which I toiled and in which I have shown myself wise under the sun. This also is vanity. 20 Therefore I turned my heart and despaired of all the labor in which I had toiled under the sun. 21 For there is a man whose labor is with wisdom, knowledge, and skill; yet he must leave his heritage to a man who has not labored for it. This also is vanity and a great evil. 22 For what has man for all his labor, and for the striving of his heart with which he has toiled under the sun? 23 For all his days are sorrowful, and his work burdensome; even in the night his heart takes no rest. This also is vanity. 24 Nothing is better for a man than that he should eat and drink, and that his soul should enjoy good in his labor. This also, I saw, was from the hand of God. 25 For who can eat, or who can have enjoyment, more than I? 26 For God gives wisdom and knowledge and joy to a man who is good in His sight; but to the sinner He gives the work of gathering and collecting, that he may give to him who is good before God. This also is vanity and grasping for the wind. The Word of the Lord! Thanks be to God! Second Lesson Galatians 4:11-31 11 I am afraid for you, lest I have labored for you in vain. 12 Brethren, I urge you to become like me, for I became like you. You have not injured me at all. 13 You know that because of physical infirmity I preached the gospel to you at the first. 14 And my trial which was in my flesh you did not despise or reject, but you received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus. 15 What then was the blessing you enjoyed? For I bear you witness that, if possible, you would have plucked out your own eyes and given them to me. 16 Have I therefore become your enemy because I tell you the truth? 17 They zealously court you, but for no good; yes, they want to exclude you, that you may be zealous for them. 18 But it is good to be zealous in a good thing always, and not only when I am present with you. 19 My little children, for whom I labor in birth again until Christ is formed in you, 20 I would like to be present with you now and to change my tone; for I have doubts about you. 21 Tell me, you who desire to be under the law, do you not hear the law? 22 For it is written that Abraham had two sons: the one by a bondwoman, the other by a freewoman. 23 But he who was of the bondwoman was born according to the flesh, and he of the freewoman through promise, 24 which things are symbolic. For these are the two covenants: the one from Mount Sinai which gives birth to bondage, which is Hagar 25 for this Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia, and corresponds to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children 26 but the Jerusalem above is free, which is the mother of us all. 27 For it is written: Rejoice, O barren, You who do not bear! Break forth and shout, You who are not in labor! For the desolate has many more children Than she who has a husband. 28 Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are children of promise. 29 But, as he who was born according to the flesh then persecuted him who was born according to the Spirit, even so it is now. 30 Nevertheless what does the Scripture say? Cast out the bondwoman and her son, for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman. 31 So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman but of the free.

I believe in one God: the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth, and of all things visible and invisible; And in one Lord, Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son of God, begotten of His Father before all worlds, God of God, Light of Light, very God of very God, begotten, not made, being of one substance with the Father; by Whom all things were made; Who for us men, and for our salvation, came down from Heaven, and was incarnate by the Holy Ghost of the virgin, Mary, and was made man; and was crucified also for us under Pontius Pilate; He suffered, and was buried, and the third day He rose again according to the Scriptures; and ascended into Heaven, and sitteth at the right hand of the Father; and He shall come again with glory to judge both the quick and the dead; Whose kingdom shall have no end. And I believe in the Holy Ghost, the Lord and Giver of life, Who proceedeth from the Father and the Son; Who with the Father and the Son together is worshipped and glorified; Who spoke through the prophets.

Therefore Lift up your hearts! We lift them up to the Lord! Please be seated. How Shall We Then Live? Let us hear from God's Word. First Lesson Genesis 15:1-6 15 After these things the word of the Lord came to Abram in a vision, saying, Do not be afraid, Abram. I am your shield, [a]your exceedingly great reward. 2 But Abram said, Lord God, what will You give me, seeing I [b]go childless, and the heir of my house is Eliezer of Damascus? 3 Then Abram said, Look, You have given me no offspring; indeed one[c] born in my house is my heir! 4 And behold, the word of the Lord came to him, saying, This one shall not be your heir, but one who will come from your own body shall be your heir. 5 Then He brought him outside and said, Look now toward heaven, and count the stars if you are able to number them. And He said to him, So shall your descendants be. 6 And he believed in the Lord, and He accounted it to him for righteousness. The Word of the Lord! Thanks be to God! Second Lesson Galatians 5:1-15 5 Stand fast therefore in the liberty by which Christ has made us free, and do not be entangled again with a yoke of bondage. 2 Indeed I, Paul, say to you that if you become circumcised, Christ will profit you nothing. 3 And I testify again to every man who becomes circumcised that he is a debtor to keep the whole law. 4 You have become estranged from Christ, you who attempt to be justified by law; you have fallen from grace. 5 For we through the Spirit eagerly wait for the hope of righteousness by faith. 6 For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision avails anything, but faith working through love. 7 You ran well. Who hindered you from obeying the truth? 8 This persuasion does not come from Him who calls you. 9 A little leaven leavens the whole lump. 10 I have confidence in you, in the Lord, that you will have no other mind; but he who troubles you shall bear his judgment, whoever he is. 11 And I, brethren, if I still preach circumcision, why do I still suffer persecution? Then the offense of the cross has ceased. 12 I could wish that those who trouble you would even cut themselves off! 13 For you, brethren, have been called to liberty; only do not use liberty as an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another. 14 For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. 15 But if you bite and devour one another, beware lest you be consumed by one another! The Word of the Lord! Thanks be to God! (Now RISE for our Gospel Lesson and song) Gospel Lesson Luke 12:22-34 The Gospel of the Kingdom! Praise be to the Lord Jesus Christ! The Gloria Patri Glory be to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Ghost! As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be. World without end. Amen, Amen! *PRAYER FOR ILLUMINATION Gracious Father, Truly You have bestowed Your Riches upon us. For indeed the Word is near to us. You have put it in our mouths and in our hearts.

There you shall bring all that I command you: your burnt offerings, your sacrifices, your tithes, the wave offerings of your hand, and all your choice offerings which you vow to the Lord.

CONFESSION OF SIN.............................................(Kneeling if able) Let Us Pray Together: I, a poor sinner, acknowledge before you, my God and Creator, that I have terribly and in many ways sinned against you, not only outwardly, but much more with inward blindness, unbelief, doubts, despondency, impatience, pride, covetousness, envy, hatred, malice, and other sinful affections, as you, my Lord and God, know well, and I cannot deeply enough deplore.

For day and night Your hand was heavy upon me; my vitality was turned into the drought of summer. I acknowledged my sin to You, and my iniquity I have not hidden. I said, ""I will confess my transgression to the Lord,"" and You forgave the iniquity of my sin. [Our Heavenly Father, in His great mercy, has given His only Son up to death for us. He is the just Judge of the living and the dead, but in Christ, His mercy and forgiveness are given. To you who confess your sin to God apart from spiritual guile, not hiding your sin, but acknowledging it to Him God, Himself, by the blood of His Son, covers your sin, and does not impute your iniquity. Christian, your sins are forgiven for Jesus sake. Therefore lift up your hearts! Leader: Lift up your hearts! People: We lift them up to the Lord Please be seated. How Shall We Then Live? Let us hear from God's Word. First Lesson Jeremiah 23:16-29 6 Thus says the Lord of hosts: Do not listen to the words of the prophets who prophesy to you. They make you worthless; They speak a vision of their own heart, Not from the mouth of the Lord. 17 They continually say to those who despise Me, ‘The Lord has said, You shall have peace '; And to everyone who walks according to the dictates of his own heart, they say, ‘No evil shall come upon you.' 18 For who has stood in the counsel of the Lord, And has perceived and heard His word? Who has marked His word and heard it? 19 Behold, a whirlwind of the Lord has gone forth in fury A violent whirlwind! It will fall violently on the head of the wicked. 20 The anger of the Lord will not turn back Until He has executed and performed the thoughts of His heart. In the latter days you will understand it perfectly. 21 I have not sent these prophets, yet they ran. I have not spoken to them, yet they prophesied. 22 But if they had stood in My counsel, And had caused My people to hear My words, Then they would have turned them from their evil way and from the evil of their doings. 23 Am I a God near at hand, says the Lord, And not a God afar off? 24 Can anyone hide himself in secret places, So I shall not see him? says the Lord; Do I not fill heaven and earth? says the Lord. 25 I have heard what the prophets have said who prophesy lies in My name, saying, ‘I have dreamed, I have dreamed!' 26 How long will this be in the heart of the prophets who prophesy lies? Indeed they are prophets of the deceit of their own heart, 27 who try to make My people forget My name by their dreams which everyone tells his neighbor, as their fathers forgot My name for Baal. 28 The prophet who has a dream, let him tell a dream; And he who has My word, let him speak My word faithfully. What is the chaff to the wheat? says the Lord. 29 Is not My word like a fire? says the Lord, And like a hammer that breaks the rock in pieces? The Word of the Lord! Thanks be to God! Second Lesson Galatians 5.13-26 13 For you, brethren, have been called to liberty; only do not use liberty as an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another. 14 For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. 15 But if you bite and devour one another, beware lest you be consumed by one another! 16 I say then: Walk in the Spirit, and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh. 17 For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; and these are contrary to one another, so that you do not do the things that you wish. 18 But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law. 19 Now the works of the flesh are evident, which are: adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lewdness, 20 idolatry, sorcery, hatred, contentions, jealousies, outbursts of wrath, selfish ambitions, dissensions, heresies, 21 envy, murders, drunkenness, revelries, and the like; of which I tell you beforehand, just as I also told you in time past, that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God. 22 But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, 23 gentleness, self-control. Against such there is no law. 24 And those who are Christ's have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires. 25 If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit. 26 Let us not become conceited, provoking one another, envying one another. The Word of the Lord! Thanks be to God! (Now RISE for our Gospel Lesson and song) Gospel Lesson Luke 12:49-56 The Gospel of the Kingdom! Praise be to the Lord Jesus Christ!

For the poor will never cease from the land; therefore I command you, saying, 'You shall open your hand wide to your brother, to your poor and your needy, in your land.' Our Gracious Heavenly Father, Give us the grace of Your Holy Spirit not to harden our hearts, nor grumble, nor close our hands to our poor brethren, knowing that Your word has forbidden it, and promised blessing because of it. We present these gifts to You today as tokens of ourselves, our minds, our bodies, our time, our talents, our interests, our possessions, and our whole personalities; all offered up to You for Your good pleasure.

Rise now and let us pray for the Church and the World Gracious Father, We thank You for the blood of Christ, which brought about our redemption, the forgiveness of our sins, and for His body and cross which united those who were far off and those who were near in one body to You.

But now we are Your workmanship, created in Christ Jesus, so continue to strengthen us by Your Spirit that we should walk in the good works which You have prepared before us. We pray this not only for ourselves but for all Your Church in all the world.

Build up and bless Your Church and equip Her leaders especially in these lands.

Sustain prisoners and kindly grant their release. Overthrow those who have targeted the Bride of Christ for destruction and who persecute Your people. Hasten the day when Mohammedism, Hinduism, and every other false religion of the world no longer deceives the nations, and each one is baptized and discipled in all the holy commandments of Your Son, Jesus Christ. Father, also bless Your churches, ministers, refugees, and those caring for them in Russia, Ukraine, and border regions.

I believe in one God: the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth, and of all things visible and invisible; And in one Lord, Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son of God, begotten of His Father before all worlds, God of God, Light of Light, very God of very God, begotten, not made, being of one substance with the Father; by Whom all things were made; Who for us men, and for our salvation, came down from Heaven, and was incarnate by the Holy Ghost of the virgin, Mary, and was made man; and was crucified also for us under Pontius Pilate; He suffered, and was buried, and the third day He rose again according to the Scriptures; and ascended into Heaven, and sitteth at the right hand of the Father; and He shall come again with glory to judge both the quick and the dead; Whose kingdom shall have no end. And I believe in the Holy Ghost, the Lord and Giver of life, Who proceedeth from the Father and the Son; Who with the Father and the Son together is worshipped and glorified; Who spoke through the prophets.

And they shall declare My glory among the Gentiles. 20 Then they shall bring all your brethren for an offering to the Lord out of all nations, on horses and in chariots and in litters, on mules and on camels, to My holy mountain Jerusalem, says the Lord, as the children of Israel bring an offering in a clean vessel into the house of the Lord. 21 And I will also take some of them for priests and Levites, says the Lord. 22 For as the new heavens and the new earth Which I will make shall remain before Me, says the Lord, So shall your descendants and your name remain. 23 And it shall come to pass That from one New Moon to another, And from one Sabbath to another, All flesh shall come to worship before Me, says the Lord. 24 And they shall go forth and look Upon the corpses of the men Who have transgressed against Me. For their worm does not die, And their fire is not quenched. They shall be an abhorrence to all flesh. The Word of the Lord! Thanks be to God!

When you beat your olive trees, you shall not go over the branches a second time; it shall be left as it is for the foreigner, the fatherless, and the widow. When you gather the grapes of your vineyard, you shall not glean it a second time; it shall be left as it is for the foreigner, the fatherless, and the widow. And you shall remember that you were once a slave in the land of Egypt; for that reason I command you to do this thing.

Sanctus THE LORD CONSECRATES US (Please be seated) First Lesson Proverbs 25:2-10 It is the glory of God to conceal a matter, But the glory of kings is to search out a matter. 3 As the heavens for height and the earth for depth, So the heart of kings is unsearchable. 4 Take away the dross from silver, And it will go to the silversmith for jewelry. 5 Take away the wicked from before the king, And his throne will be established in righteousness. 6 Do not exalt yourself in the presence of the king, And do not stand in the place of the great; 7 For it is better that he say to you, Come up here, Than that you should be put lower in the presence of the prince, Whom your eyes have seen. 8 Do not go hastily to court; For what will you do in the end, When your neighbor has put you to shame? 9 Debate your case with your neighbor, And do not disclose the secret to another; 10 Lest he who hears it expose your shame, And your reputation be ruined. The Word of the Lord! Thanks be to God! Second Lesson Galatians 6:6-18 6 Let him who is taught the word share in all good things with him who teaches. 7 Do not be deceived, God is not mocked; for whatever a man sows, that he will also reap. 8 For he who sows to his flesh will of the flesh reap corruption, but he who sows to the Spirit will of the Spirit reap everlasting life. 9 And let us not grow weary while doing good, for in due season we shall reap if we do not lose heart. 10 Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all, especially to those who are of the household of faith. 11 See with what large letters I have written to you with my own hand! 12 As many as desire to make a good showing in the flesh, these would compel you to be circumcised, only that they may not suffer persecution for the cross of Christ. 13 For not even those who are circumcised keep the law, but they desire to have you circumcised that they may boast in your flesh. 14 But God forbid that I should boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world. 15 For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision avails anything, but a new creation. 16 And as many as walk according to this rule, peace and mercy be upon them, and upon the Israel of God. 17 From now on let no one trouble me, for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus. 18 Brethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.

Second Lesson Philemon 1 Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon our beloved friend and fellow laborer, 2 to [a]the beloved Apphia, Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church in your house: 3 Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 4 I thank my God, making mention of you always in my prayers, 5 hearing of your love and faith which you have toward the Lord Jesus and toward all the saints, 6 that the sharing of your faith may become effective by the acknowledgment of every good thing which is in [b]you in Christ Jesus. 7 For we [c]have great [d]joy and [e]consolation in your love, because the [f]hearts of the saints have been refreshed by you, brother. 8 Therefore, though I might be very bold in Christ to command you what is fitting, 9 yet for love's sake I rather appeal to you being such a one as Paul, the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ 10 I appeal to you for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten while in my chains, 11 who once was unprofitable to you, but now is profitable to you and to me. 12 I am sending him [g]back. You therefore receive him, that is, my own [h]heart, 13 whom I wished to keep with me, that on your behalf he might minister to me in my chains for the gospel. 14 But without your consent I wanted to do nothing, that your good deed might not be by compulsion, as it were, but voluntary. 15 For perhaps he departed for a while for this purpose, that you might receive him forever, 16 no longer as a slave but more than a slave a beloved brother, especially to me but how much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord. 17 If then you count me as a partner, receive him as you would me. 18 But if he has wronged you or owes anything, put that on my account. 19 I, Paul, am writing with my own hand. I will repay not to mention to you that you owe me even your own self besides. 20 Yes, brother, let me have joy from you in the Lord; refresh my heart in the Lord. 21 Having confidence in your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even more than I say. 22 But, meanwhile, also prepare a guest room for me, for I trust that through your prayers I shall be granted to you. 23 Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, greets you, 24 as do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, Luke, my fellow laborers. 25 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.

I believe in one God: the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth, and of all things visible and invisible; And in one Lord, Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son of God, begotten of His Father before all worlds, God of God, Light of Light, very God of very God, begotten, not made, being of one substance with the Father; by Whom all things were made; Who for us men, and for our salvation, came down from Heaven, and was incarnate by the Holy Ghost of the virgin, Mary, and was made man; and was crucified also for us under Pontius Pilate; He suffered, and was buried, and the third day He rose again according to the Scriptures; and ascended into Heaven, and sitteth at the right hand of the Father; and He shall come again with glory to judge both the quick and the dead; Whose kingdom shall have no end. And I believe in the Holy Ghost, the Lord and Giver of life, Who proceedeth from the Father and the Son; Who with the Father and the Son together is worshipped and glorified; Who spoke through the prophets.

Entrance Psalm 62 Truly my soul silently waits for God; FROM HIM COMES MY SALVATION. He only is my rock and my salvation; HE IS MY DEFENSE; I SHALL NOT BE GREATLY MOVED. How long will you attack a man? YOU SHALL BE SLAIN, ALL OF YOU, LIKE A LEANING WALL AND A TOTTERING FENCE. They only consult to cast him down from his high position; They delight in lies; THEY BLESS WITH THEIR MOUTH, BUT THEY CURSE INWARDLY. My soul, wait silently for God alone, For my expectation is from Him. HE ONLY IS MY ROCK AND MY SALVATION; HE IS MY DEFENSE; I SHALL NOT BE MOVED. In God is my salvation and my glory; THE ROCK OF MY STRENGTH, AND MY REFUGE, IS IN GOD. Trust in Him at all times, you people; Pour out your heart before Him; GOD IS A REFUGE FOR US. Surely men of low degree are a vapor, MEN OF HIGH DEGREE ARE A LIE; If they are weighed on the scales, THEY ARE ALTOGETHER LIGHTER THAN VAPOR. Do not trust in oppression, Nor vainly hope in robbery; IF RICHES INCREASE, DO NOT SET YOUR HEART ON THEM. God has spoken once, Twice I have heard this: That power belongs to God. ALSO TO YOU, O LORD, BELONGS MERCY; FOR YOU RENDER TO EACH ONE ACCORDING TO HIS WORK.

And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For Thine is the Kingdom, and the Power, and the Glory. Forever and ever. Amen. People of God, we are in need of His cleansing and renewal. Therefore, let us kneel and confess our sins together, in humble reliance upon the grace of God, first silently then in unison. LET US PRAY TOGETHER Most merciful god, I confess to you that I am from birth sinful and unclean, and that I have sinned against you in thought, word, and deed; not only in outward transgressions, but also in secret thoughts and desires that I am not able to fully understand, but which are all known to you. For this reason, I flee for refuge to your infinite mercy, continually seeking and imploring your grace, through my Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. * Arise and hear the good news of God's forgiveness! Isaiah 55 Seek the Lord while He may be found, Call upon Him while He is near. 7 Let the wicked forsake his way, And the unrighteous man his thoughts; Let him return to the Lord, And He will have mercy on him; Return to our God, For He will abundantly pardon. To you who have sought the Lord's mercy by confessing your sins and turning from unrighteous thoughts to the way of His Son God assures you once more than He has heard your prayers and for Christ's sake forgives all your sins. Therefore Lift up your hearts! We lift them up to the Lord! Sanctus Please be seated. How Shall We Then Live? Let us hear from God's Word. First Lesson Habakkuk 1:1-4; 2:1-4 1 The burden which the prophet Habakkuk saw. 2 O Lord, how long shall I cry, And You will not hear? Even cry out to You, Violence! And You will not save. 3 Why do You show me iniquity, And cause me to see trouble? For plundering and violence are before me; There is strife, and contention arises. 4 Therefore the law is powerless, And justice never goes forth. For the wicked surround the righteous; Therefore perverse judgment proceeds. I will stand my watch And set myself on the rampart, And watch to see what He will say to me, And what I will answer when I am corrected. 2 Then the Lord answered me and said: Write the vision and make it plain on tablets, That he may run who reads it. 3 For the vision is yet for an appointed time; But at the end it will speak, and it will not lie. Though it tarries, wait for it; Because it will surely come, It will not tarry. 4 Behold the proud, His soul is not upright in him; But the just shall live by his faith. The Word of the Lord! Thanks be to God! Second Lesson I Timothy 2:8-15 8 I desire therefore that the men pray everywhere, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting; 9 in like manner also, that the women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with propriety and moderation, not with braided hair or gold or pearls or costly clothing, 10 but, which is proper for women professing godliness, with good works. 11 Let a woman learn in silence with all submission. 12 And I do not permit a woman to teach or to have authority over a man, but to be in silence. 13 For Adam was formed first, then Eve. 14 And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived, fell into transgression. 15 Nevertheless she will be saved in childbearing if they continue in faith, love, and holiness, with self-control. The Word of the Lord! Thanks be to God! (Please RISE for our Hymn) (Please Remain Standing for our Gospel Lesson and song) Gospel Lesson Luke 17:1-10 The Gospel of the Kingdom!

Do not forget to entertain strangers, for by so doing some have unwittingly entertained angels.

Our Gracious Heavenly Father, You have told us that what we do for the least of Your brothers, we do for You the feeding of the hungry and thirsty, the welcoming of a stranger, the clothing of the naked, the visiting of the sick or persecuted (Matt.25:35).

Instead give us Your heart to share what we have, our wealth, our homes, our time, our abilities and our energies to minster faithfully to the needs of those around us.

Thank you for the many ways in which we have seen it diminished in recent years. Continue these victories by Your mercy. Change the minds and melt the hearts of all who promote this evil, or who seek abortion as a remedy for the troubles of their lives, which troubles are for many very great. Make us in our lives a testimony of sexual purity, cherishers of human life, lovers and helpers of our neighbors, guardians and adopters of the fatherless and unwanted, honorers of Your holy image wherever it is found in mankind, and willing sacrificers of ourselves, our comforts and possessions in service to Your Kingdom and Your righteousness.

Let us hear from God's Word. First Lesson Ruth 1.1-19a 1 Now it came to pass, in the days when the judges ruled, that there was a famine in the land. And a certain man of Bethlehem, Judah, went to dwell in the country of Moab, he and his wife and his two sons. 2 The name of the man was Elimelech, the name of his wife was Naomi, and the names of his two sons were Mahlon and Chilion Ephrathites of Bethlehem, Judah. And they went to the country of Moab and remained there. 3 Then Elimelech, Naomi's husband, died; and she was left, and her two sons. 4 Now they took wives of the women of Moab: the name of the one was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth. And they dwelt there about ten years. 5 Then both Mahlon and Chilion also died; so the woman survived her two sons and her husband. 6 Then she arose with her daughters-in-law that she might return from the country of Moab, for she had heard in the country of Moab that the Lord had visited His people by giving them bread. 7 Therefore she went out from the place where she was, and her two daughters-in-law with her; and they went on the way to return to the land of Judah. 8 And Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, Go, return each to her mother's house. The Lord deal kindly with you, as you have dealt with the dead and with me. 9 The Lord grant that you may find rest, each in the house of her husband. So she kissed them, and they lifted up their voices and wept. 10 And they said to her, Surely we will return with you to your people. 11 But Naomi said, Turn back, my daughters; why will you go with me? Are there still sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands? 12 Turn back, my daughters, go for I am too old to have a husband. If I should say I have hope, if I should have a husband tonight and should also bear sons, 13 would you wait for them till they were grown? Would you restrain yourselves from having husbands? No, my daughters; for it grieves me very much for your sakes that the hand of the Lord has gone out against me! 14 Then they lifted up their voices and wept again; and Orpah kissed her mother-in-law, but Ruth clung to her. 15 And she said, Look, your sister-in-law has gone back to her people and to her gods; return after your sister-in-law. 16 But Ruth said: Entreat me not to leave you, or to turn back from following after you; For wherever you go, I will go; and wherever you lodge, I will lodge; Your people shall be my people, and your God, my God. 17 Where you die, I will die, and there will I be buried.

But he said, I will not let You go unless You bless me! 27 So He said to him, What is your name? He said, Jacob. 28 And He said, Your name shall no longer be called Jacob, but Israel; for you have struggled with God and with men, and have prevailed. 29 Then Jacob asked, saying, Tell me Your name, I pray. And He said, Why is it that you ask about My name? And He blessed him there. 30 So Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: For I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved. The Word of the Lord! Thanks be to God! Second Lesson 1 Timothy 3:8-16 8 Likewise deacons must be reverent, not double-tongued, not given to much wine, not greedy for money, 9 holding the mystery of the faith with a pure conscience. 10 But let these also first be tested; then let them serve as deacons, being found blameless. 11 Likewise, their wives must be reverent, not slanderers, temperate, faithful in all things. 12 Let deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well. 13 For those who have served well as deacons obtain for themselves a good standing and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus. 14 These things I write to you, though I hope to come to you shortly; 15 but if I am delayed, I write so that you may know how you ought to conduct yourself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth. 16 And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifested in the flesh, Justified in the Spirit, Seen by angels, Preached among the Gentiles, Believed on in the world, Received up in glory.

Can faith save him? If a brother or sister is naked and destitute of daily food, and one of you says to them, ""Depart in peace, be warmed and filled,"" but you do not give them the things which are needed for the body, what does it profit? Thus also faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead.

(Please be seated) Preaching of the Word Pastor Ben Rossell THE LORD COLLECTS OUR GIFTS Offertory Great is Thy Faithfulness Presentation of Tithes and Offering James 5:1-5 -- Come now, you rich, weep and howl for your miseries that are coming upon you! Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are moth-eaten. Your gold and silver are corroded, and their corrosion will be a witness against you and will eat your flesh like fire. You have heaped up treasure in the last days. Indeed the wages of the laborers who mowed your fields, which you kept back by fraud, cry out; and the cries of the reapers have reached the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth. You have lived on the earth in pleasure and luxury; you have fattened your hearts as in a day of slaughter. Our Gracious Heavenly Father, You have blessed us materially with great abundance so that luxuries of all kinds surround us every day and make our living pleasant and easy. Keep us from being rich fools, and laying up treasure for ourselves, while not being rich toward God (Luke 6:19-20). Grant us the grace and wisdom of Your Holy Spirit to think Your Own thoughts about money and material possessions. Deliver us from making idols of personal peace and affluence while ignoring the needs of those You have sent to us. Receive these gifts we present to You now. Give the elders and deacons of Your church wisdom as we seek to use this money to spread the gospel and meet physical needs. In Jesus' name. AMEN. Now rise! And let us pray for the Church and the world! Gracious Father, We thank You for Your tender kindness to us not only for delivering us from the fear of death, but for Your lavish gifts and comforts in our daily lives. Grant us Your grace to be strengthened and bettered by these, rather than spoiled and led by a desire for comforts and riches. Establish us in Godly contentment, that we never be guilty of idolatry before You. We pray this not only for ourselves but for all Your Church in all the world. In our own community, we lift up to You Forest Lake Bible Church and elders Tidwell and Aldridge and Pastor Thomas as he preaches there today. We ask that You would fill them with all wisdom and grace and use that congregation in this community and in its ministry throughout the world. And give us a true and Biblical unity with this church and the other churches of the community. We lift up to You the work of Your gospel ministers all over the world especially the ministry of Thomas and Julie and their ministry in southeast Asia especially as Thomas prepares to teach in their church this month in November, and as their care groups divide and branch out. Travel into nearby Malaysia to meet with other ministry partners. Also bless and uphold each member of their family and their health as well. Outside our community, we lift up to You Your persecuted people all over the world, especially today asking Your mercy for our brothers and sisters in NEPAL For Pastor Keshab and all those like him jailed for their Christian witness and Gospel outreach. Bless and uphold him and those who advocate for him through the legal process. Return him from jail to Gospel ministry. And bless Your Church there that She might flourish with peace in all devotion and reverence. Grant them Your peace, even in the midst of their distress. Rise up, O Father, and deliver Your children from their oppressors, from the plans and actions of wicked men who have set themselves against You and Your children. Grant wisdom, justice, and effectiveness to every leader and authority involved. Father, also bless Your churches, ministers, refugees, and those caring for them in Russia, Ukraine, and border regions. Bring a swift end to all hostilities and grant Your people across that region true unity in the Holy Spirit. OH LORD, HEAR OUR PRAYERS. For You are gracious. We humbly pray that you would heal the sick in our midst, that You would show favor to Your children. We lift up to You those who are afflicted by all manner of suffering. we pray for: Jim Jordan Rick Mallick Dr Bob & Trinky Grete Vivian Hamilton, Wanda Sadler David Larrimore Crystal Clark Andrea Mosley Charlotte Nelson Joseph & Spencer Harris Mike Lawyer Murray Hemstreet Teddy Fulmer Zoribel DeJesus Harold Thomas David Goetsch Julie Mosley Steve Wilkins Gracia Thomas Judy Wells Charlotte and John Mathers As well as each one we name before You now in our silent prayers We give You thanks and ask Your protection for of our expectant mothers Andrea Mosley, Lindsey Aiken, Emily Knie, Ashton Beno, and Brittany Waldron, Jane Ellen DeJesus, Tori Patterson, and Bonnie Rossell - together with their unborn children.

Father, bless also those in our congregation and community applying for exemptions to the vaccine mandate. Provide for them in all their needs and grant them favor in the eyes of their supervisors and commanding officers. Good Shepherd, heal Your sheep and tend Your Lambs. OH LORD, HEAR OUR PRAYERS. For You are gracious. You are our Creator as well as Savior, and we thank You for the wonder of our being, You have told us plainly in Your Word that 22 Wives are to submit to their own husbands, as to the Lord in all things and that husbands, are to love their wives, just as Christ also loved the Church and gave Himself for Her, But we have turned from goodness to our own twisted ways. Wives refuse the beauty of loving submission and husbands shrink back from laying down their lives in loving sacrifice. Femininity is mocked and masculinity has given way to perpetual adolescence and self-service. You have made us male and female, in Your holy image, but we reject the wisdom of Your calling upon us as men or women and our confusion is our shame and harm. For Your ways are the ways of life and apart from them is darkness and death. So deliver us and our children after us from temptation and folly. Grant us joy in our calling to be men and women, and as we are faithful to live it out, especially in Christian marriages - empower us by the might of Your Holy Spirit to shine with glory as lights to the world in this way. LORD, HEAR OUR PRAYERS. For You are gracious. Now our Father as we come to this Your table, we thank You that You have not withheld these from us indeed You've not withheld even Your Own and only begotten Son but delivered Him up as a sacrifice whose holy body was broken to feed us and give life to the world. Give us Your blessings now, for we ask all these things in the strong and holy name of Your Son, Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen. Nicene Creed Christians, in Whom do you trust?

And I believe in the Holy Ghost, the Lord and Giver of life, Who proceedeth from the Father and the Son; Who with the Father and the Son together is worshipped and glorified; Who spoke through the prophets.

Baptism of Olivia Jackson Entrance Hymn Beneath the Blood-stained Lintel Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one! You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your strength. And these words which I command you today shall be in your heart. You shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in your house, when you walk by the way, when you lie down, and when you rise up For the promise is to you and to your children, and to all who are afar off, as many as the Lord our God will call. (Deut 6:4-7; Acts 2:39). DEARLY BELOVED, the sacrament of baptism is for little children because God our Father, Who has redeemed us by the sacrifice of Christ, is also the God and Father of our children. They belong, with us who believe, to the membership of the Church through the covenant made with Christ. Our own Westminster Confession of Faith says that baptism is a sign and seal of the covenant of grace, of our ingrafting into Christ, of regeneration, of remission of sins, and of our giving up unto God, through Jesus Christ, to walk in the newness of life. Our Lord Jesus said, Allow the little children to come unto Me, and do not forbid them, for of such is the kingdom of God. Steve and Amy, is Jesus Christ your only Lord and Savior? You know that, in presenting your son, that God requires things of you 1. In presenting your daughter for baptism, you are acknowledging your need and hers of the cleansing blood of Jesus Christ and the renewing grace of the Holy Spirit. 2. You are claiming God's covenant promise in her behalf, God's promise to be a God to you and to your descendants after you, and you are looking in faith to the Lord Jesus Christ for her salvation, as you do for your own. 3. You are now unreservedly committing her to God, and promising, in humble reliance upon divine grace, that you will endeavor to set before her a Godly example, that you will pray with and for her, that you will teach her the doctrines of the Christian faith, and that you will strive, by all the means of God's appointment, to bring her up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord. These are the baptismal duties God requires of you do you vow to obey Him by His grace and help? [response: We do] QUESTION TO THE CONGREGATION: God calls you as the Body of Christ to assist these parents in the Christian nurture of this child? Will you respond with a hearty Amen and commit to undertake this responsibility by God's grace and help? AMEN What is this child's name? OLIVIA, I BAPTIZE YOU IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER AND THE SON AND THE HOLY SPIRIT. THE BLESSINGS OF THE TRIUNE GOD BE WITH YOU ALWAYS. Little child, for you Jesus Christ came into the world, suffered and did battle. For you He faced the blackness of Gethsemane and the terrors of Calvary. For you He cried out It is finished! For you He overcame death by death, was buried, and ascended into Heaven, where for you, He is right now, interceding. All these things while you are too young to even know what they mean. And so the word of the Apostle is confirmed: We love Him because first, He loved us. DECLARATION: This child, being thus baptized, is a member of the household of faith; committed to the care and instruction of these parents and this congregation, to the end that she may mature and grow strong as a disciple of the Lord Jesus Christ, and serve in the royal priesthood of God's elect from every tribe and tongue and nation. Jesus said, Whoever receives one such little child in My name, receives Me. Please rise for our prayer of blessing which we will close together by singing of the Lord's Prayer: Eternal and Almighty God, You righteously judged the unfaithful world through flood waters, but in Your great mercy, saved faithful Noah with his household. You drowned hard-hearted Pharaoh with all his army in the Sea, but led Your people Israel through on dry ground, prefiguring the washing of Your holy baptism. By the baptism of Your dear Son, You sanctified and set apart the Jordan River and all water for a saving flood, and an ample washing away of sins. Through Your same infinite mercy, graciously look down now upon Henry, and bless her with a right faith in the Spirit, so that through this saving flood all that was born in him from Adam and all that has been added to it might be drowned and cleansed. Separate him now from the unfaithful, and preserve him in the holy ark of Christendom dry and safe, ever fervent in spirit and joyful in hope to serve Your holy name, so that he, together with us and all Your Faithful, may be worthy to inherit Your promise of eternal life, through Christ Jesus our Lord. Now hear us as we sing the prayer He taught us: Our Father, who art in Heaven, Hallowed be Thy Name. Thy Kingdom Come. Thy will be done, on earth as it is in Heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, And forgive us our debts, as we forgive, our debtors. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For Thine is the Kingdom, and the Power, and the Glory. Forever and ever. Amen. THE LORD CLEANSES US Saints of God, today we remember the work of God to reform His Church a work of reforming that God works always first and foremost in and from our own hearts we are in need of cleansing and renewal. Let us call upon the mercy of our heavenly Father. Let us kneel and confess our sins together, in humble reliance upon the grace of God, first silently, then together. Let us pray together Most merciful God, I confess to You that I am by nature sinful and unclean, and that I have sinned against You in thought, word, and deed; not only in outward transgressions, but also in secret thoughts and desires that I am not able to understand, but which are all known to You. For this reason, I flee for refuge to Your infinite mercy, seeking and imploring your grace, through my Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Cleansing of Sin Arise and hear the good news of God's forgiveness! Romans 3:19-22 Now we know that whatever the law says, it says to those who are under the law, that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God. Therefore by the deeds of the law no flesh will be justified in His sight, for by the law is the knowledge of sin. But now the righteousness of God apart from the law is revealed, being witnessed by the Law and the Prophets, even the righteousness of God which is through faith in Jesus Christ to all and on all who believe. [ To you who confess your sin to God and seek His forgiveness through Jesus, to you who have stopped your mouth from excuse-making and self justification, and have confessed that with all the world you stand guilty before God God declares that you are righteous in His sight together with all who believe in Jesus. Beloved in the Lord, for Christ's sake, all your sins are forgiven. Therefore ] Lift up your hearts! We lift them up to the Lord! Please be seated. First Lesson Revelation 14:6-7 6 Then I saw another angel flying in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach to those who dwell on the earth to every nation, tribe, tongue, and people 7 saying with a loud voice, Fear God and give glory to Him, for the hour of His judgment has come; and worship Him who made heaven and earth, the sea and springs of water. The Word of the Lord! Thanks be to God! Second Lesson 1 Timothy 4.1-5 4 Now the Spirit expressly says that in latter times some will depart from the faith, giving heed to deceiving spirits and doctrines of demons, 2 speaking lies in hypocrisy, having their own conscience seared with a hot iron, 3 forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from foods which God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth. 4 For every creature of God is good, and nothing is to be refused if it is received with thanksgiving; 5 for it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.

You have no need of our money or gifts as if we could bribe the almighty with full hands and empty hearts. When we are at odds with our brethren, our offerings are vain and meaningless.

Thy will be done, on earth as it is in Heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, And forgive us our debts, as we forgive, our debtors. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For Thine is the Kingdom, and the Power, and the Glory. Forever and ever. Amen. THE LORD CLEANSES US Saints of God, we are in need of cleansing and renewal. Let us call upon the mercy of our heavenly Father. Let us kneel and confess our sins together, in humble reliance upon the grace of God, first silently, then together. (Please Kneel) Let us pray together O God our heavenly Father, we confess to you that we have grievously sinned against you in thought, word, and deed; not only in outward transgressions, but also in secret thoughts and desires that we are unable to fully understand, but which are all known to you. We are in need of deliverance from your enemies and our infirmities. For this reason, we flee for refuge to your infinite mercy, seeking and imploring your forgiveness and deliverance, through Jesus Christ our Lord, Amen. Arise and hear the good news of God's forgiveness! Hear now the comforting assurance of the grace of God, promised in the Gospel to all who believe. Holy Scripture says: For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him might not perish, but have everlasting life. All who continue to love their sin and shame, and persist in them, even against the conviction of their own conscience, I must declare to you, by God's command, that His wrath and judgment abides upon you, and that your sins are retained in heaven, and you will not be delivered from eternal judgment, unless you repent. But, to every one of you beloved brothers and sisters, who hate your sins, and seek pardon through the merits of Jesus Christ alone, and who resolve each day to turn from your sins and to the Lord, to serve Him in true holiness and righteousness: I declare, according to God's command, that from heaven you are released from all your sins (as Christ has promised in His Gospel), through the perfect satisfaction of the most holy passion and death of our Lord Jesus Christ. And since we do not doubt that our prayers and worship are sanctified by the sufferings of Jesus Christ, and therefore acceptable and well-pleasing to God, I call upon you now, to Lift up your hearts! We lift them up to the Lord! Sanctus Please be seated. How Shall We Then Live? Let us hear from God's Word. First Lesson Malachi 4.1-6 For behold, the day is coming, Burning like an oven, And all the proud, yes, all who do wickedly will be stubble. And the day which is coming shall burn them up, Says the Lord of hosts, That will leave them neither root nor branch. 2 But to you who fear My name The Sun of Righteousness shall arise With healing in His wings; And you shall go out And grow fat like stall-fed calves. 3 You shall trample the wicked, For they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet On the day that I do this, Says the Lord of hosts. 4 Remember the Law of Moses, My servant, Which I commanded him in Horeb for all Israel, With the statutes and judgments. 5 Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet Before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord. 6 And he will turn The hearts of the fathers to the children, And the hearts of the children to their fathers, Lest I come and strike the earth with a curse. The Word of the Lord! Thanks be to God! Second Lesson 1 Timothy 5.1-16 Do not rebuke an older man, but exhort him as a father, younger men as brothers, 2 older women as mothers, younger women as sisters, with all purity. 3 Honor widows who are really widows. 4 But if any widow has children or grandchildren, let them first learn to show piety at home and to repay their parents; for this is good and acceptable before God. 5 Now she who is really a widow, and left alone, trusts in God and continues in supplications and prayers night and day. 6 But she who lives in pleasure is dead while she lives. 7 And these things command, that they may be blameless. 8 But if anyone does not provide for his own, and especially for those of his household, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever. 9 Do not let a widow under sixty years old be taken into the number, and not unless she has been the wife of one man, 10 well reported for good works: if she has brought up children, if she has lodged strangers, if she has washed the saints' feet, if she has relieved the afflicted, if she has diligently followed every good work. 11 But refuse the younger widows; for when they have begun to grow wanton against Christ, they desire to marry, 12 having condemnation because they have cast off their first faith. 13 And besides they learn to be idle, wandering about from house to house, and not only idle but also gossips and busybodies, saying things which they ought not. 14 Therefore I desire that the younger widows marry, bear children, manage the house, give no opportunity to the adversary to speak reproachfully. 15 For some have already turned aside after Satan. 16 If any believing man or woman has widows, let them relieve them, and do not let the church be burdened, that it may relieve those who are really widows. The Word of the Lord! Thanks be to God! (Now Please stand for our Epistle Hymn) God, My King, Thy Might Confessing, Psalm 145 (RISE for our Gospel Lesson and song) Gospel Lesson Luke 21:5-28 The Gospel of the Kingdom!

And I believe in the Holy Ghost, the Lord and Giver of life, Who proceedeth from the Father and the Son; Who with the Father and the Son together is worshipped and glorified; Who spoke through the prophets.

Therefore, Let us humbly kneel, and make confession to God, imploring his forgiveness, through Jesus Christ our Lord. *CONFESSION OF SIN... (Psalm 51)...... LET US PRAY TOGETHER Most merciful God, I confess to You that I am by nature sinful and unclean, and that I have sinned against You in thought, word, and deed; not only in outward transgressions, but also in secret thoughts and desires that I am not able to understand, but which are all known to You. For this reason, I flee for refuge to Your infinite mercy, seeking and imploring your grace, through my Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Cleansing of Sin Arise and hear the good news of God's forgiveness! Romans 5:7-8; 8:1 ...scarcely for a righteous man will one die; though perhaps for a good man one would even dare to die. But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us .There is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus, who do not walk according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit. [To all who confess their sin to God and seek His forgiveness, to you who recognize that you are not righteous, but a sinner, God declares that even while you were yet a sinner, Christ died for you. To you who do not walk according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit, God declares that there is now no condemnation for you and that, for Christ's sake, all your sins are forgiven. Therefore Lift up your hearts! We lift them up to the Lord! Sanctus Please be seated. How Shall We Then Live? Let us hear from God's Word. First Lesson Isaiah 2:1-5 The word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem. 2 Now it shall come to pass in the latter days That the mountain of the Lord's house Shall be established on the top of the mountains, And shall be exalted above the hills; And all nations shall flow to it. 3 Many people shall come and say, Come, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, To the house of the God of Jacob; He will teach us His ways, And we shall walk in His paths. For out of Zion shall go forth the law, And the word of the Lord from Jerusalem. 4 He shall judge between the nations, And rebuke many people; They shall beat their swords into plowshares, And their spears into pruning hooks; Nation shall not lift up sword against nation, Neither shall they learn war anymore. 5 O house of Jacob, come and let us walk In the light of the Lord. The Word of the Lord! Thanks be to God! Second Lesson 1 Timothy 5:17-25 17 Let the elders who rule well be counted worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in the word and doctrine. 18 For the Scripture says, You shall not muzzle an ox while it treads out the grain, and, The laborer is worthy of his wages. 19 Do not receive an accusation against an elder except from two or three witnesses. 20 Those who are sinning rebuke in the presence of all, that the rest also may fear. 21 I charge you before God and the Lord Jesus Christ and the elect angels that you observe these things without prejudice, doing nothing with partiality. 22 Do not lay hands on anyone hastily, nor share in other people's sins; keep yourself pure. 23 No longer drink only water, but use a little wine for your stomach's sake and your frequent infirmities. 24 Some men's sins are clearly evident, preceding them to judgment, but those of some men follow later. 25 Likewise, the good works of some are clearly evident, and those that are otherwise cannot be hidden.

But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you. Our Gracious Heavenly Father, You have told us not to be anxious about our lives worrying about what we are going to eat or drink or wear. You lavishly provide for the birds and the flowers.

Help us to rest in Your great love and Your wise provision. By Your Spirit, cause us to see our lives as part of Your great kingdom, and to seek it first with Your righteousness.

Rise and worship the Triune God Sing and Rejoice, for lo, I come; And God will dwell in our midst, says the Lord. It is high time to awake out of your sleep: For now is the time of our salvation nearer than when we first believed. The night is far spent, the day is at hand: Let us therefore cast off the works of darkness and put on the armor of light. Entrance Psalm Entrance Psalm 72a Give the king Your judgments, O God, AND YOUR RIGHTEOUSNESS TO THE KING'S SON. He will judge Your people with righteousness, AND YOUR POOR WITH JUSTICE. The mountains will bring peace to the people, AND THE LITTLE HILLS, BY RIGHTEOUSNESS. He will bring justice TO THE POOR OF THE PEOPLE; He will save the children of the needy, AND WILL BREAK IN PIECES THE OPPRESSOR. They shall fear You as long as the sun and moon endure, THROUGHOUT ALL GENERATIONS. He shall come down like rain upon the mown grass, LIKE SHOWERS THAT WATER THE EARTH. In His days the righteous shall flourish, AND ABUNDANCE OF PEACE, UNTIL THE MOON IS NO MORE. He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, AND FROM THE RIVER TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH. Those who dwell in the wilderness will bow before Him, AND HIS ENEMIES WILL LICK THE DUST. Entrance Hymn Jesus Shall Reign, Psalm 72 We praise You, Father, for being our strength and refuge. You shelter us under the shadow of Your mighty wing. And Your salvation is near to those who fear You, that glory may dwell in our land. In Your Son, Mercy and truth have met together, righteousness and peace have kissed each other. Truth has sprung out of the earth, and righteousness has come down from heaven. Stir up our hearts, O Lord, to prepare the way for Your Son. By His coming, give us strength to shed His light abroad. Make His footsteps our pathway. For we ask it in the name of Your only begotten Son Jesus, singing the prayer He has given us The Lord's Prayer (arr. Nikolai Kedrov) Our Father, who art in Heaven, Hallowed be Thy Name. Thy Kingdom Come. Thy will be done, on earth as it is in Heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, And forgive us our debts, as we forgive, our debtors. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For Thine is the Kingdom, and the Power, and the Glory. Forever and ever. Amen. *CONFESSION OF SIN People of God we are in need of cleansing and renewal. Let us humbly kneel, and make confession to God, imploring his forgiveness, through Jesus Christ our Lord. (Let all who are able kneel) CONFESSION OF SIN................................. LET US PRAY TOGETHER Most merciful God, I confess to You that I am by nature sinful and unclean, and that I have sinned against You in thought, word, and deed; not only in outward transgressions, but also in secret thoughts and desires that I am not able to understand, but which are all known to You. For this reason, I flee for refuge to Your infinite mercy, seeking and imploring your grace, through my Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. ASSURANCE OF FORGIVENESS Arise and hear the good news of God's FORGIVENESS ROMANS 8:32-34 He who did not spare His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not with Him also freely give us all things? Who shall bring a charge against God's elect? It is God who justifies. Who is he who condemns? It is Christ Jesus who died, yes, who was raised from the dead, Who is at the right hand of God, who indeed intercedes for us. Our heavenly father, in His great mercy, did not spare His own Son, but has delivered Him up for us all. He does not condemn you, but for Christ's sake forgives all your sins. Therefore Lift up your hearts! We lift them up to the Lord! Sanctus Please be seated. How Shall We Then Live? Let us hear from God's Word. First Lesson Isaiah 11:1-10 There shall come forth a Rod from the stem of Jesse, And a Branch shall grow out of his roots. 2 The Spirit of the Lord shall rest upon Him, The Spirit of wisdom and understanding, The Spirit of counsel and might, The Spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the Lord. 3 His delight is in the fear of the Lord, And He shall not judge by the sight of His eyes, Nor decide by the hearing of His ears; 4 But with righteousness He shall judge the poor, And decide with equity for the meek of the earth; He shall strike the earth with the rod of His mouth, And with the breath of His lips He shall slay the wicked. 5 Righteousness shall be the belt of His loins, And faithfulness the belt of His waist. 6 The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, The leopard shall lie down with the young goat, The calf and the young lion and the fatling together; And a little child shall lead them. 7 The cow and the bear shall graze; Their young ones shall lie down together; And the lion shall eat straw like the ox. 8 The nursing child shall play by the cobra's hole, And the weaned child shall put his hand in the viper's den. 9 They shall not hurt nor destroy in all My holy mountain, For the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord As the waters cover the sea. 10 And in that day there shall be a Root of Jesse, Who shall stand as a banner to the people; For the Gentiles shall seek Him, And His resting place shall be glorious. The Word of the Lord! Thanks be to God! Second Lesson 1 Timothy 6:1-10 Let as many bondservants as are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honor, so that the name of God and His doctrine may not be blasphemed. 2 And those who have believing masters, let them not despise them because they are brethren, but rather serve them because those who are benefited are believers and beloved. Teach and exhort these things. 3 If anyone teaches otherwise and does not consent to wholesome words, even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which accords with godliness, 4 he is proud, knowing nothing, but is obsessed with disputes and arguments over words, from which come envy, strife, reviling, evil suspicions, 5 useless wranglings of men of corrupt minds and destitute of the truth, who suppose that godliness is a means of gain. From such withdraw yourself. 6 Now godliness with contentment is great gain. 7 For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out. 8 And having food and clothing, with these we shall be content. 9 But those who desire to be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and harmful lusts which drown men in destruction and perdition. 10 For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil, for which some have strayed from the faith in their greediness, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows. The Word of the Lord! Thanks be to God! (Now RISE for our Hymn) I Greet Thee Who My Sure Redeemer Art Gospel Lesson Matthew 3:1-12 The Gospel of the Kingdom! Praise be to the Lord Jesus Christ! The Gloria Patri Glory be to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Ghost! As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be. World without end. Amen, Amen! *PRAYER FOR ILLUMINATION . . The life and strength of grass withers, the beauty of the flower fades, But Your word , O Lord our God, stands forever in life, strength, beauty, and truth. Blow the wind of your Spirit and kindle in us the flames of holy zeal.

(Let all who are able kneel) CONFESSION OF SIN........................... LET US PRAY TOGETHER Most Merciful God Arise and hear the good news of God's forgiveness!........II Corinthians 7:10 [The Apostle Paul wrote to the Corinthians] godly sorrow produces repentance leading to salvation, not to be regretted; but the sorrow of the world produces death. For observe this very thing, that you sorrowed in a godly manner: What diligence it produced in you, what clearing of yourselves, what indignation, what fear, what vehement desire, what zeal, what vindication! In all things you proved yourselves to be cleared [from sin]. [Your heavenly father, in His great mercy, has given His only Son to die for us, and to you, who sorrow with godly sorrow leading to repentance and salvation, and fear and zeal, God declares that for Christ's sake all our sins are forgiven.] Therefore, Lift up your hearts! We lift them up to the Lord! Sanctus Please be seated. How Shall We Then Live? Let us hear from God's Word. First Lesson Isaiah 7:10-17 10 Moreover the Lord spoke again to Ahaz, saying, 11 Ask a sign for yourself from the Lord your God; ask it either in the depth or in the height above. 12 But Ahaz said, I will not ask, nor will I test the Lord! 13 Then he said, Hear now, O house of David! Is it a small thing for you to weary men, but will you weary my God also? 14 Therefore the Lord Himself will give you a sign: Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a Son, and shall call His name Immanuel. 15 Curds and honey He shall eat, that He may know to refuse the evil and choose the good. 16 For before the Child shall know to refuse the evil and choose the good, the land that you dread will be forsaken by both her kings. 17 The Lord will bring the king of Assyria upon you and your people and your father's house days that have not come since the day that Ephraim departed from Judah. The Word of the Lord! Thanks be to God! Second Lesson 1 Timothy 6:9-21 9 But those who desire to be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and harmful lusts which drown men in destruction and perdition. 10 For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil, for which some have strayed from the faith in their greediness, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows. 11 But you, O man of God, flee these things and pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, gentleness. 12 Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, to which you were also called and have confessed the good confession in the presence of many witnesses. 13 I urge you in the sight of God who gives life to all things, and before Christ Jesus who witnessed the good confession before Pontius Pilate, 14 that you keep this commandment without spot, blameless until our Lord Jesus Christ's appearing, 15 which He will manifest in His own time, He who is the blessed and only [e]Potentate, the King of kings and Lord of lords, 16 who alone has immortality, dwelling in unapproachable light, whom no man has seen or can see, to whom be honor and everlasting power. Amen. 17 Command those who are rich in this present age not to be haughty, nor to trust in uncertain riches but in the living God, who gives us richly all things to enjoy. 18 Let them do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to give, willing to share, 19 storing up for themselves a good foundation for the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life. 20 O Timothy! Guard what was committed to your trust, avoiding the profane and [f]idle babblings and contradictions of what is falsely called knowledge 21 by professing it some have strayed concerning the faith. Grace be with you. Amen. The Word of the Lord! Thanks be to God! (Please stand for our Epistle Hymn) Immortal, Invisible, God Only-wise Gospel Lesson Matthew 1:18-25 The Gospel of the Kingdom!

Break forth into joy! Sing together, you waste places of Jerusalem! For the Lord has comforted His people. He has redeemed Jerusalem! Rise and let us worship God! We are gathered in the name of God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit. Amen. For unto us a child is born Unto us a Son is given And the government shall be upon His shoulder: And His name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor, the mighty God, the everlasting Father, the Prince of Peace. Glory to God in the Highest And on earth, peace and good will toward men. Entrance Psalm 2 Why do the nations rage, AND THE PEOPLE PLOT A VAIN THING? The kings of the earth set themselves, AND THE RULERS TAKE COUNSEL TOGETHER, Against the Lord and against His anointed, saying, ""LET US BREAK THEIR BONDS IN PIECES AND CAST AWAY THEIR CORDS FROM US."" He who sits in the heavens shall laugh; THE LORD SHALL HOLD THEM IN DERISION. Then He shall speak to them in His wrath, AND DISTRESS THEM IN HIS DEEP DISPLEASURE: ""Yet I have set My King on My holy hill of Zion."" ""I WILL DECLARE THE DECREE: The Lord has said to Me, 'YOU ARE MY SON, TODAY I HAVE BEGOTTEN YOU. Ask of Me, and I will give you the nations for your inheritance, AND THE ENDS OF THE EARTH FOR YOUR POSSESSION. You shall break them with a rod of iron; YOU SHALL DASH THEM IN PIECES LIKE A POTTER'S VESSEL.'"" Now therefore, be wise, O kings; BE INSTRUCTED, YOU JUDGES OF THE EARTH, Serve the Lord with fear, AND REJOICE WITH TREMBLING. Kiss the Son, lest He be angry, AND YOU PERISH IN THE WAY, When His wrath is kindled but a little. BLESSED ARE ALL THOSE WHO PUT THEIR TRUST IN HIM. Entrance Hymn Beneath the Blood-stained Lintel Baptism of Cassius Quentin Knie Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one! You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your strength. And these words which I command you today shall be in your heart. You shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in your house, when you walk by the way, when you lie down, and when you rise up For the promise is to you and to your children, and to all who are afar off, as many as the Lord our God will call. (Deut 6:4-7; Acts 2:39). DEARLY BELOVED, the sacrament of baptism is for little children because God our Father, Who has redeemed us by the sacrifice of Christ, is also the God and Father of our children. They belong, with us who believe, to the membership of the Church through the covenant made with Christ. Our own Westminster Confession of Faith says that baptism is a sign and seal of the covenant of grace, of our ingrafting into Christ, of regeneration, of remission of sins, and of our giving up unto God, through Jesus Christ, to walk in the newness of life. Our Lord Jesus said, Allow the little children to come unto Me, and do not forbid them, for of such is the kingdom of God. Trever and Emily, is Jesus Christ your only Lord and Savior? You know that, in presenting your son, that God requires things of you 1. In presenting your son for baptism, you are acknowledging your need and his of the cleansing blood of Jesus Christ and the renewing grace of the Holy Spirit. 2. You are claiming God's covenant promise in his behalf, God's promise to be a God to you and to your descendants after you, and you are looking in faith to the Lord Jesus Christ for his salvation, as you do for your own. 3. You are now unreservedly committing him to God, and promising, in humble reliance upon divine grace, that you will endeavor to set before him a Godly example, that you will pray with and for her, that you will teach him the doctrines of the Christian faith, and that you will strive, by all the means of God's appointment, to bring him up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord. These are the baptismal duties God requires of you do you vow to obey Him by His grace and help? [response: We do] QUESTION TO THE CONGREGATION: God calls you as the Body of Christ to assist these parents in the Christian nurture of this child? Will you respond with a hearty Amen and commit to undertake this responsibility by God's grace and help? AMEN What is this child's name? Cassius Quentin, I BAPTIZE YOU IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER AND THE SON AND THE HOLY SPIRIT. THE BLESSINGS OF THE TRIUNE GOD BE WITH YOU ALWAYS. DECLARATION: This child, being thus baptized, is a member of the household of faith; committed to the care and instruction of these parents and this congregation, to the end that she may mature and grow strong as a disciple of the Lord Jesus Christ, and serve in the royal priesthood of God's elect from every tribe and tongue and nation. Jesus said, Whoever receives one such little child in My name, receives Me. In the words of the Ministers of the Westminster Assembly, our forefathers in the faith, I want to admonish every one of you present who just witnessed this baptism to look back to your own baptism; Now, what does that mean? It means a few things: First looking back to your own baptism means repenting right now - of any sins against your covenant with God; If you are living in sin, remember your baptismal duties to God and repent, today! And second, stir up your faith; the world around us in no help to a right faith a life of trusting obedience to God and hope in His promises to be fulfilled in us as we persevere to the end. So stir up your faith; nurture it; feed it; exercise it; strengthen it keep on. In these ways you will improve and make right use of your baptism, for there is a covenant sealed by your baptism betwixt God and your soul. Never forget it. It is a great honor and gift to belong to God in this way. Please rise for our prayer of blessing which we will close together by singing of the Lord's Prayer: Eternal and Almighty God, You righteously judged the unfaithful world through flood waters, but in Your great mercy, saved faithful Noah with his household. You drowned hard-hearted Pharaoh with all his army in the Sea, but led Your people Israel through on dry ground, prefiguring the washing of Your holy baptism. By the baptism of Your dear Son, You sanctified and set apart the Jordan River and all water for a saving flood, and an ample washing away of sins. Through Your same infinite mercy, graciously look down now upon Henry, and bless her with a right faith in the Spirit, so that through this saving flood all that was born in him from Adam and all that has been added to it might be drowned and cleansed. Separate him now from the unfaithful, and preserve him in the holy ark of Christendom dry and safe, ever fervent in spirit and joyful in hope to serve Your holy name, so that he, together with us and all Your Faithful, may worthily inherit Your promise of eternal life, through Christ Jesus our Lord. Now hear us as we sing the prayer He taught us: Our Father, who art in Heaven, Hallowed be Thy Name. Thy Kingdom Come. Thy will be done, on earth as it is in Heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, And forgive us our debts, as we forgive, our debtors. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For Thine is the Kingdom, and the Power, and the Glory. Forever and ever. Amen. THE LORD CLEANSES US People of God, we who are washed still need God's continual cleansing and renewal. So as Scripture calls us to bow before God in worship, I invite all who are able to kneel for prayer now as we pray first silently, and then corporately, confessing our sins to God. CONFESSION OF SIN...................... LET US PRAY TOGETHER Let us pray together Most merciful God, I confess to You that I am by nature sinful and unclean, and that I have sinned against You in thought, word, and deed; not only in outward transgressions, but also in secret thoughts and desires that I am not able to understand, but which are all known to You. For this reason, I flee for refuge to Your infinite mercy, seeking and imploring your grace, through my Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Cleansing of Sin Arise and hear the good news of God's forgiveness! I John 1:8-9; 4:10 - If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness .Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son to be the propitiation for our sins. To you who have confessed the truth that you have sin asking God's forgiveness by faith in Christ the Father assures you that He has heard your prayer and that for the Son's sake all our sins are forgiven. Therefore,Lift up your hearts! People: We lift them up to the Lord. Holy, Holy, Holy Please be seated. How Shall We Then Live? Let us hear from God's Word. Isaiah 52:7-10 7 How beautiful upon the mountains Are the feet of him who brings good news, Who proclaims peace, Who brings glad tidings of good things, Who proclaims salvation, Who says to Zion, Your God reigns! 8 Your watchmen shall lift up their voices, With their voices they shall sing together; For they shall see eye to eye When the Lord brings back Zion. 9 Break forth into joy, sing together, You waste places of Jerusalem! For the Lord has comforted His people, He has redeemed Jerusalem. 10 The Lord has made bare His holy arm In the eyes of all the nations; And all the ends of the earth shall see The salvation of our God. The Word of the Lord! Thanks be to God! Second Lesson Hebrews 1:1-6 1 God, who at various times and in various ways spoke in time past to the fathers by the prophets, 2 has in these last days spoken to us by His Son, whom He has appointed heir of all things, through whom also He made the worlds; 3 who being the brightness of His glory and the express image of His person, and upholding all things by the word of His power, when He had by Himself purged our sins, sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high, 4 having become so much better than the angels, as He has by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they. 5 For to which of the angels did He ever say: You are My Son, Today I have begotten You? And again: I will be to Him a Father, And He shall be to Me a Son? 6 But when He again brings the firstborn into the world, He says: Let all the angels of God worship Him. The Word of the Lord! Thanks be to God! (Please stand for our Epistle Hymn, Good Christian Men, Rejoice!) (Please remain standing for our Gospel Lesson and song) Gospel Lesson John 1:1-14 The Gospel of the Kingdom!

And I believe in the Holy Ghost, the Lord and Giver of life, Who proceedeth from the Father and the Son; Who with the Father and the Son together is worshipped and glorified; Who spoke through the prophets.

Therefore, You are just as both Witness and Judge. Truly, I was brought forth in iniquity, and in sin my mother conceived me. Behold, You desire truth in the inward parts, and in the hidden part You will make me to know wisdom. So purge me with hyssop and I shall be clean. Wash me and I shall be whiter than snow, for the sake of Your Son, my Lord, Jesus Christ.

So He became their Savior. 9 In all their affliction He was afflicted, And the Angel of His Presence saved them; In His love and in His pity He redeemed them; And He bore them and carried them All the days of old. 10 But they rebelled and grieved His Holy Spirit; So He turned Himself against them as an enemy, And He fought against them. 11 Then he remembered the days of old, Moses and his people, saying: Where is He who brought them up out of the sea With the shepherd of His flock? Where is He who put His Holy Spirit within them, 12 Who led them by the right hand of Moses, With His glorious arm, Dividing the water before them To make for Himself an everlasting name, 13 Who led them through the deep, As a horse in the wilderness, That they might not stumble? 14 As a beast goes down into the valley, And the Spirit of the Lord causes him to rest, So You lead Your people, To make Yourself a glorious name.

I believe in one God: the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth, and of all things visible and invisible; And in one Lord, Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son of God, begotten of His Father before all worlds, God of God, Light of Light, very God of very God, begotten, not made, being of one substance with the Father; by Whom all things were made; Who for us men, and for our salvation, came down from Heaven, and was incarnate by the Holy Ghost of the virgin, Mary, and was made man; and was crucified also for us under Pontius Pilate; He suffered, and was buried, and the third day He rose again according to the Scriptures; and ascended into Heaven, and sitteth at the right hand of the Father; and He shall come again with glory to judge both the quick and the dead; Whose kingdom shall have no end. And I believe in the Holy Ghost, the Lord and Giver of life, Who proceedeth from the Father and the Son; Who with the Father and the Son together is worshipped and glorified; Who spoke through the prophets. And I believe one, holy, catholic, and apostolic Church; I acknowledge one baptism for the remission of sins; and I look for the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come. Amen.

I Chronicles 29:10-19 Blessed are You, O Lord the God of Jacob our Father, for ever and ever. Yours, O Lord, is the greatness and the power and the glory; the victory and the majesty; all that is in the heavens and in the earth is Yours. Yours is the kingdom, O Lord, and You are exalted as Head above all. In Your hand are power and might; You make great; You give strength to all. Thank You, our God, for calling us a people who walked in great darkness into Your marvelous light. Hear us in our prayers and fill us and our world with even more of Your gospel light. And hear us now as we sing the prayer our Lord Jesus has given us: The Lord's Prayer (arr. Nikolai Kedrov) Our Father, who art in Heaven, Hallowed be Thy Name. Thy Kingdom Come. Thy will be done, on earth as it is in Heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, And forgive us our debts, as we forgive, our debtors. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For Thine is the Kingdom, and the Power, and the Glory. Forever and ever. Amen. THE LORD CLEANSES US < The Sin Offering > People of God called out darkness called to continue in cleansing and renewal - Let us humbly kneel, and make confession to God, imploring his forgiveness through Jesus Christ our Lord. [Pause ] Let us pray together Have mercy upon me, O God, According to Your loving-kindness; According to the multitude of Your tender mercies, Blot out my transgressions. Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin. For I acknowledge my transgressions, and my sin is always before me. I have sinned against You, O God, and done evil in Your sight. Therefore, You are just as both Witness and Judge. Truly, I was brought forth in iniquity, and in sin my mother conceived me. Behold, You desire truth in the inward parts, and in the hidden part You will make me to know wisdom. So purge me with hyssop and I shall be clean. Wash me and I shall be whiter than snow, for the sake of Your Son, my Lord, Jesus Christ. Amen! * ASSURANCE OF FORGIVENESS Arise and hear good news Exodus 12:12-13; 23 [The Lord said to Israel]: I will pass through the land of Egypt on that night, and will strike all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment: I am the Lord. Now the blood shall be a sign for you on the houses where you are. And when I see the blood, I will pass over you; and the plague shall not be on you to destroy you when I strike the land of Egypt . [To you, covenant people, whose homes are marked by the blood of the Lamb, and whose very bodies are marked by the water of baptism, God declares that Christ is our Passover and for His sake all your sins are forgiven and the righteous judgment which falls on the wicked will not fall on you]. Lift up your hearts! We lift them up to the Lord! (Please be seated) First Lesson Isaiah 42:1-9 42 Behold! My Servant whom I uphold, My Elect One in whom My soul delights! I have put My Spirit upon Him; He will bring forth justice to the Gentiles. 2 He will not cry out, nor raise His voice, Nor cause His voice to be heard in the street. 3 A bruised reed He will not break, And smoking flax He will not quench; He will bring forth justice for truth. 4 He will not fail nor be discouraged, Till He has established justice in the earth; And the coastlands shall wait for His law. 5 Thus says God the Lord, Who created the heavens and stretched them out, Who spread forth the earth and that which comes from it, Who gives breath to the people on it, And spirit to those who walk on it: 6 I, the Lord, have called You in righteousness, And will hold Your hand; I will keep You and give You as a covenant to the people, As a light to the Gentiles, 7 To open blind eyes, To bring out prisoners from the prison, Those who sit in darkness from the prison house. 8 I am the Lord, that is My name; And My glory I will not give to another, Nor My praise to carved images. 9 Behold, the former things have come to pass, And new things I declare; Before they spring forth I tell you of them. The Word of the Lord! Thanks be to God! Second Lesson Romans 6:1-11 What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin that grace may abound? 2 Certainly not! How shall we who died to sin live any longer in it? 3 Or do you not know that as many of us as were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into His death? 4 Therefore we were buried with Him through baptism into death, that just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life. 5 For if we have been united together in the likeness of His death, certainly we also shall be in the likeness of His resurrection, 6 knowing this, that our old man was crucified with Him, that the body of sin might be done away with, that we should no longer be slaves of sin. 7 For he who has died has been freed from sin. 8 Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with Him, 9 knowing that Christ, having been raised from the dead, dies no more. Death no longer has dominion over Him. 10 For the death that He died, He died to sin once for all; but the life that He lives, He lives to God. 11 Likewise you also, reckon yourselves to be dead indeed to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus our Lord. The Word of the Lord! Thanks be to God! (Now RISE for our Hymn) Please remain standing for our Gospel Lesson Matthew 3:13-17 The Gospel of the Kingdom! Praise be to the Lord Jesus Christ!

Gracious Father, You are truly our Father and have declared us to be Your children in our baptisms. Forgive us for our doubting and forgetting what You are like, and what Your Son has done for us, and what the Spirit is to us and in us. In Your Own words from Ephesians 3: Give us the power of Your Spirit, so that as Christ dwells in our hearts by faith we would be rooted and grounded in Your love. Enable us, somehow, to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth to know the love of Christ which surpasses knowing and to be filled up with all of Your Own fullness. Father, it's hard for us to even know what these things mean, but we pray them in the child-like faith that You will hear despite our ignorance and graciously answer in ways beyond anything we can even imagine, by Your Own power at work within us. And we pray these blessings not only for ourselves but for all Your Church in all the world. In our own community, we lift up to You Sovereign Grace Church and pastor Bill Cain.

For You are gracious. Gracious Father, Let Your way be known upon earth; Your saving health among all nations. Thank You for showing the light of the Gospel in our land: extend Your mercy also to the nations of the world that still walk in darkness. Enlighten the Muslims with the knowledge of Your truth; and grant that the heart of all the peoples may be turned to You; We especially pray for the Tidwells and those others who minister at Memorial Christian Hospital in Bangladesh to Rohinga refugees, neighbors, and imams. Bless their personal and family life, the children in their schooling, and guard and uphold their health in this season. OH LORD, HEAR OUR PRAYERS. For You are gracious. And now our Father as we come to Your table, we can only do so because You have shown mercy to every nation and have called us out of our darkness into Your Kingdom; to join the company of Saints, and martyrs, and confessors; the faithful from every age who have witnessed a good confession, as Your chosen vessels of grace and light to the world. Give us grace so to follow them as they followed Christ; to whom with You and the Holy Spirit be all honor and glory, world without end, Amen. Nicene Creed Christians, in Whom do you trust?

Isaiah 49:1-7 & 1 Corinthians 1:1-9 First Lesson Isaiah 49:1-7 49 Listen, O coastlands, to Me, And take heed, you peoples from afar! The Lord has called Me from the womb; From the matrix of My mother He has made mention of My name. 2 And He has made My mouth like a sharp sword; In the shadow of His hand He has hidden Me, And made Me a polished shaft; In His quiver He has hidden Me. 3 And He said to me, ‘You are My servant, O Israel, In whom I will be glorified.' 4 Then I said, ‘I have labored in vain, I have spent my strength for nothing and in vain; Yet surely my just reward is with the Lord, And my work with my God.' 5 And now the Lord says, Who formed Me from the womb to be His Servant, To bring Jacob back to Him, So that Israel is gathered to Him (For I shall be glorious in the eyes of the Lord, And My God shall be My strength), 6 Indeed He says, ‘It is too small a thing that You should be My Servant To raise up the tribes of Jacob, And to restore the preserved ones of Israel; I will also give You as a light to the Gentiles, That You should be My salvation to the ends of the earth.' 7 Thus says the Lord, The Redeemer of Israel, [e]their Holy One, To Him whom man despises, To Him whom the nation abhors, To the Servant of rulers: Kings shall see and arise, Princes also shall worship, Because of the Lord who is faithful, The Holy One of Israel; And He has chosen You.

All the nations will be gathered before Him, and He will separate them one from another, as a shepherd divides his sheep from the goats. And He will set the sheep on His right hand, but the goats on the left. Then the King will say to those on His right hand, 'Come, you blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world: for I was hungry and you gave Me food; I was thirsty and you gave Me drink; I was a stranger and you took Me in; I was naked and you clothed Me; I was sick and you visited Me; I was in prison and you came to Me.' Then the righteous will answer Him, saying, 'Lord, when did we see You hungry and feed You, or thirsty and give You drink? When did we see You a stranger and take You in, or naked and clothe You? Or when did we see You sick, or in prison, and come to You?' And the King will answer and say to them, 'Assuredly, I say to you, inasmuch as you did it to one of the least of these My brethren, you did it to Me.' Our Gracious Heavenly Father, guard us from the great sin of indifference to the needs and care of the least of our brethren. You have taught us that we will be judged by our response to these, and that by ministering to Your people in difficult circumstances, we are actually ministering to You. Give us wisdom and grace to be faithful to Your Word which teaches us that He who has pity on the poor lends to the Lord, and He will pay back what he has given (Prov.19:17). We give ourselves to You, with these offerings today, bless them to be useful in Your service. For we ask it in the name of Your Son Jesus Christ, who lived and died in care and provision for us. AMEN. Now Rise! And pray together with me for the Church and the world! Gracious Father, We thank You for Your Son, our Lord Jesus. He is the joy of man's desiring; the One for Whom our hearts always hunger. Even our sinful desires are just twisted impressions of the God-shaped void within us. And our hearts are always restless until they find their rest in You. So shine the light of Your face upon us and bless us to draw us under the shadow of Your wing. Set our feet to walk on Your path in the steps of Your Son, our Lord Jesus, and fill us in our emptiness with your Holy Spirit. We pray these things not only for ourselves, but for all Your Church in all the world In our own community, we lift up to You: Cornerstone Church of Valparaiso and their pastoral search.

Nicene Creed Christians, in Whom do you trust? I believe in one God: the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth, and of all things visible and invisible; And in one Lord, Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son of God, begotten of His Father before all worlds, God of God, Light of Light, very God of very God, begotten, not made, being of one substance with the Father; by Whom all things were made; Who for us men, and for our salvation, came down from Heaven, and was incarnate by the Holy Ghost of the virgin, Mary, and was made man; and was crucified also for us under Pontius Pilate; He suffered, and was buried, and the third day He rose again according to the Scriptures; and ascended into Heaven, and sitteth at the right hand of the Father; and He shall come again with glory to judge both the quick and the dead; Whose kingdom shall have no end. And I believe in the Holy Ghost, the Lord and Giver of life, Who proceedeth from the Father and the Son; Who with the Father and the Son together is worshipped and glorified; Who spoke through the prophets. And I believe one, holy, catholic, and apostolic Church; I acknowledge one baptism for the remission of sins; and I look for the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come. Amen.

Entrance Hymn Holy, Holy ,Holy Philippians 2:5-8 Eternal and ever-blessed God, You are Lord over all things. You made the entire universe, and it belongs to You and is under Your control. And we are Your creatures. We bow before You to worship and adore You. Your Son Jesus, Whom men crucified, You have exalted as both Lord and Christ (Acts 2:36) and given Him the name which is above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those in heaven, and of those on earth, and of those under the earth, and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father. So bless us this morning and hear us as we sing together the prayer He has given us The Lord's Prayer (arr. Nikolai Kedrov) Our Father, who art in Heaven, Hallowed be Thy Name. Thy Kingdom Come. Thy will be done, on earth as it is in Heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, And forgive us our debts, as we forgive, our debtors. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For Thine is the Kingdom, and the Power, and the Glory. Forever and ever. Amen. People of God Scripture tells us that we are the people of His pasture and the sheep of His Hand, and as such, we are called to worship and bow down, kneeling before Yahweh our Maker. Therefore I invite all who are able to humbly kneel, as we make confession to God, imploring his forgiveness through Jesus Christ our Lord. (Please Kneel) Let us pray together Have mercy upon me, O God, According to Your loving-kindness; According to the multitude of Your tender mercies, Blot out my transgressions. Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin. For I acknowledge my transgressions, and my sin is always before me. I have sinned against You, O God, and done evil in Your sight. Therefore, You are just as both Witness and Judge. Truly, I was brought forth in iniquity, and in sin my mother conceived me. Behold, You desire truth in the inward parts, and in the hidden part You will make me to know wisdom. So purge me with hyssop and I shall be clean. Wash me and I shall be whiter than snow, for the sake of Your Son, my Lord, Jesus Christ. Amen! Cleansing of Sin Rise and hear the good news of God's forgiveness. John 3: 16, For God so loved the world, that He gave his only begotten Son, that all who believe in Him might not perish, but have everlasting life. Any among us who refuse to repent and continue to seek pleasure in sin and shame, against our conscience, God declares His wrath and judgment will abide upon him, his sins will be retained in heaven, and he will face eternal damnation, unless he repent. But to as many of you, Beloved brethren, who abhor your sins, and resolve daily to abstain from them and to serve the Lord in true holiness and righteousness, believing in Jesus, and seeking your pardon through Him, and I declare, according to the command of God, that you are released in heaven from all your sins, (as He has promised in His gospel), through the perfect satisfaction of the most holy passion and death of our Lord Jesus Christ. Beloved of the Lord, for Christ's sake, all your sins are forgiven Therefore: Lift up your hearts! We lift them up to the Lord! Sanctus (Please be seated) How Shall We Then Live? Let us hear from God's Word. First Lesson Isaiah 58:3-9a Why have we fasted,' they say, ‘and You have not seen? Why have we afflicted our souls, and You take no notice?' In fact, in the day of your fast you find pleasure, And exploit all your laborers. 4 Indeed you fast for strife and debate, And to strike with the fist of wickedness. You will not fast as you do this day, To make your voice heard on high. 5 Is it a fast that I have chosen, A day for a man to afflict his soul? Is it to bow down his head like a bulrush, And to spread out sackcloth and ashes? Would you call this a fast, And an acceptable day to the Lord? 6 Is this not the fast that I have chosen: To loose the bonds of wickedness, To undo the heavy burdens, To let the oppressed go free, And that you break every yoke? 7 Is it not to share your bread with the hungry, And that you bring to your house the poor who are cast out; When you see the naked, that you cover him, And not hide yourself from your own flesh? 8 Then your light shall break forth like the morning, Your healing shall spring forth speedily, And your righteousness shall go before you; The glory of the Lord shall be your rear guard. 9 Then you shall call, and the Lord will answer; You shall cry, and He will say, ‘Here I am.' The Word of the Lord! Thanks be to God! Second Lesson 1 Corinthians 2:1-16 2 And I, brethren, when I came to you, did not come with excellence of speech or of wisdom declaring to you the testimony of God. 2 For I determined not to know anything among you except Jesus Christ and Him crucified. 3 I was with you in weakness, in fear, and in much trembling. 4 And my speech and my preaching were not with persuasive words of human wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power, 5 that your faith should not be in the wisdom of men but in the power of God. 6 However, we speak wisdom among those who are mature, yet not the wisdom of this age, nor of the rulers of this age, who are coming to nothing. 7 But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, the hidden wisdom which God ordained before the ages for our glory, 8 which none of the rulers of this age knew; for had they known, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory. 9 But as it is written: Eye has not seen, nor ear heard, Nor have entered into the heart of man The things which God has prepared for those who love Him. 10 But God has revealed them to us through His Spirit. For the Spirit searches all things, yes, the deep things of God. 11 For what man knows the things of a man except the spirit of the man which is in him? Even so no one knows the things of God except the Spirit of God. 12 Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, that we might know the things that have been freely given to us by God. 13 These things we also speak, not in words which man's wisdom teaches but which the Holy Spirit teaches, comparing spiritual things with spiritual. 14 But the natural man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; nor can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned. 15 But he who is spiritual judges all things, yet he himself is rightly judged by no one. 16 For who has known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct Him? But we have the mind of Christ. The Word of the Lord! Thanks be to God!

But he was sad at this word, and went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions. Then Jesus looked around and said to His disciples, ""How hard it is for those who have riches to enter the kingdom of God!"" Our Gracious Heavenly Father, guard us from all coveting that would cause us to cling to the things You call us to sacrifice. Grant us the grace of Your Holy Spirit to cherish Your Kingdom above every earthly possession and to build wealth in Heaven where You are forever.

Grant also that we may so order our whole life, all our thoughts, Words and works, that Your name may not be profaned, but adored and praised through us. So govern us, by the scepter of Your Word, and the power of Your Holy Spirit, that we and all men, may daily more subject and yield ourselves to your Divine Majesty. LORD, HEAR OUR PRAYERS.

Put Your enemies to shame by the might of Your truth and righteousness, that every power which exalts itself against Your glory may from day to day be more completely rooted up and destroyed, until the perfection of Your kingdom shall be consummated, when You shall manifest your glory in your people at the last day, and be forever all in all. Your will be done. For we pray in the name and for the sake of Christ Jesus our Lord. Amen. Nicene Creed Christians, in Whom do you trust?

Sanctus THE LORD CONSECRATES US (Please be seated) How Shall We Then Live? Let us hear from God's Word. First Lesson Genesis 3:1-21 3 Now the serpent was more crafty than any other beast of the field that the Lord God had made. He said to the woman, Did God actually say, ‘You shall not eat of any tree in the garden'? 2 And the woman said to the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees in the garden, 3 but God said, ‘You shall not eat of the fruit of the tree that is in the midst of the garden, neither shall you touch it, lest you die.' 4 But the serpent said to the woman, You will not surely die. 5 For God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil. 6 So when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she took of its fruit and ate, and she also gave some to her husband who was with her, and he ate. 7 Then the eyes of both were opened, and they knew that they were naked. And they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves loincloths. 8 And they heard the sound of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God among the trees of the garden. 9 But the Lord God called to the man and said to him, Where are you? 10 And he said, I heard the sound of you in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked, and I hid myself. 11 He said, Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten of the tree of which I commanded you not to eat? 12 The man said, The woman whom you gave to be with me, she gave me fruit of the tree, and I ate. 13 Then the Lord God said to the woman, What is this that you have done? The woman said, The serpent deceived me, and I ate. 14 The Lord God said to the serpent, Because you have done this, cursed are you above all livestock and above all beasts of the field; on your belly you shall go, and dust you shall eat all the days of your life. 15 I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and her offspring; he shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise his heel. 16 To the woman he said, I will surely multiply your pain in childbearing; in pain you shall bring forth children. Your desire shall be contrary to your husband, but he shall rule over you. 17 And to Adam he said, Because you have listened to the voice of your wife and have eaten of the tree of which I commanded you, ‘You shall not eat of it,' cursed is the ground because of you; in pain you shall eat of it all the days of your life; 18 thorns and thistles it shall bring forth for you; and you shall eat the plants of the field. 19 By the sweat of your face you shall eat bread, till you return to the ground, for out of it you were taken; for you are dust, and to dust you shall return. 20 The man called his wife's name Eve, because she was the mother of all living. 21 And the Lord God made for Adam and for his wife garments of skins and clothed them. The Word of the Lord! Thanks be to God! Second Lesson Romans 5:12-19 12 Therefore, just as sin came into the world through one man, and death through sin, and so death spread to all men because all sinned 13 for sin indeed was in the world before the law was given, but sin is not counted where there is no law. 14 Yet death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over those whose sinning was not like the transgression of Adam, who was a type of the one who was to come. 15 But the free gift is not like the trespass. For if many died through one man's trespass, much more have the grace of God and the free gift by the grace of that one man Jesus Christ abounded for many. 16 And the free gift is not like the result of that one man's sin. For the judgment following one trespass brought condemnation, but the free gift following many trespasses brought justification. 17 For if, because of one man's trespass, death reigned through that one man, much more will those who receive the abundance of grace and the free gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man Jesus Christ. 18 Therefore, as one trespass led to condemnation for all men, so one act of righteousness leads to justification and life for all men. 19 For as by the one man's disobedience the many were made sinners, so by the one man's obedience the many will be made righteous.

Let us hear from God's Word. First Lesson Genesis 12:1-9 12 Now the Lord said to Abram, Go from your country and your kindred and your father's house to the land that I will show you. 2 And I will make of you a great nation, and I will bless you and make your name great, so that you will be a blessing. 3 I will bless those who bless you, and him who dishonors you I will curse, and in you all the families of the earth shall be blessed. 4 So Abram went, as the Lord had told him, and Lot went with him. Abram was seventy-five years old when he departed from Haran. 5 And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their possessions that they had gathered, and the people that they had acquired in Haran, and they set out to go to the land of Canaan. When they came to the land of Canaan, 6 Abram passed through the land to the place at Shechem, to the oak of Moreh. At that time the Canaanites were in the land. 7 Then the Lord appeared to Abram and said, To your offspring I will give this land. So he built there an altar to the Lord, who had appeared to him. 8 From there he moved to the hill country on the east of Bethel and pitched his tent, with Bethel on the west and Ai on the east. And there he built an altar to the Lord and called upon the name of the Lord. 9 And Abram journeyed on, still going toward the Negeb. The Word of the Lord! Thanks be to God! Second Lesson Romans 4:1-8 4 What then shall we say was gained by Abraham, our forefather according to the flesh? 2 For if Abraham was justified by works, he has something to boast about, but not before God. 3 For what does the Scripture say? Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness. 4 Now to the one who works, his wages are not counted as a gift but as his due. 5 And to the one who does not work but believes in him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is counted as righteousness, 6 just as David also speaks of the blessing of the one to whom God counts righteousness apart from works: 7 Blessed are those whose lawless deeds are forgiven, and whose sins are covered; 8 blessed is the man against whom the Lord will not count his sin.

So he said, 'I will do this: I will pull down my barns and build greater, and there I will store all my crops and my goods. And I will say to my soul, ""Soul, you have many goods laid up for many years; take your ease; eat, drink, and be merry."" ' But God said to him, 'Fool! This night your soul will be required of you; then whose will those things be which you have provided?' So is he who lays up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God.""

(Let all who are able kneel) Let us pray together O God, our heavenly Father, I confess to You that I have grievously sinned against You in thought, word, and deed; not only in outward transgressions, but also in secret thoughts and desires that I am unable fully to understand, but which are all known to You.

Then I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you shall be clean; I will cleanse you from all your filthiness and from all your idols. I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you; I will take the heart of stone out of your flesh and give you a heart of flesh. I will put My Spirit within you and cause you to walk in My statutes, and you will keep My judgments and do them. Then you shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers; you shall be My people, and I will be your God. Church, you are the Israel of God. The Lord has gathered you to Himself from all nations, declared Himself to be your God, sprinkled you with the waters of baptism, cleansed you from your sins, put a new heart within you now, walk in His statutes and keep His judgments to do them! Beloved of the Lord, for Christ's sake, all your sins are forgiven, therefore Lift up your hearts!... Sanctus THE LORD CONSECRATES US (Please be seated) First Lesson Isaiah 52.1-9 52 Awake, awake! Put on your strength, O Zion; Put on your beautiful garments, O Jerusalem, the holy city! For the uncircumcised and the unclean shall no longer come to you. 2 Shake yourself from the dust, arise; Sit down, O Jerusalem! Loose yourself from the bonds of your neck, O captive daughter of Zion! 3 For thus says the Lord: You have sold yourselves for nothing, And you shall be redeemed without money. 4 For thus says the Lord God: My people went down at first Into Egypt to dwell there; Then the Assyrian oppressed them without cause. 5 Now therefore, what have I here, says the Lord, That My people are taken away for nothing? Those who rule over them make them wail, says the Lord, And My name is blasphemed continually every day. 6 Therefore My people shall know My name; Therefore they shall know in that day that I am He who speaks: ‘Behold, it is I.' 7 How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him who brings good news, Who proclaims peace, who brings glad tidings of good things, Who proclaims salvation, who says to Zion, Your God reigns! 8 Your watchmen shall lift up their voices, with their voices they shall sing together; For they shall see eye to eye when the Lord brings back Zion. 9 Break forth into joy, sing together, you waste places of Jerusalem! For the Lord has comforted His people, He has redeemed Jerusalem. The Word of the Lord! Thanks be to God! Second Lesson Romans 10:10-17 10 For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. 11 For the Scripture says, Whoever believes on Him will not be put to shame. 12 For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord over all is rich to all who call upon Him. 13 For whoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved. 14 How then shall they call on Him in whom they have not believed? And how shall they believe in Him of whom they have not heard? And how shall they hear without a preacher? 15 And how shall they preach unless they are sent? As it is written: How beautiful are the feet of those who preach the gospel of peace, Who bring glad tidings of good things! 16 But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Isaiah says, Lord, who has believed our report? 17 So then faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God. The Word of the Lord! Thanks be to God!

And if you have not been faithful in what is another man's, who will give you what is your own? No servant can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will be loyal to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon."" Our Gracious Heavenly Father, Guard us from lives of functional service to Mammon, rather than lives given over in service to You. You have taught us that if we come to love money, we will end up hating You and neglecting true service in Your Kingdom. Grant us Your Holy Spirit's grace to be faithful stewards, even in that which is least and lowly. Receive these offerings and bless them so that they might bring You glory on the earth and further Your Kingdom, in Jesus' name. AMEN.

ASSURANCE OF FORGIVENESS Arise and hear good news Ezekiel 36:24-28 Hear now the comforting assurance of the grace of God, promised in the Gospel to all who believe. Our Lord Jesus Christ says: For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him might not perish, but have everlasting life. If we continue in the love sin and shame, despite the warnings of our consciences, we abide under the wrath and judgment of God, and our sins are retained in heaven, unless we repent. But, I say to every one of you beloved brothers and sisters who believe in Jesus Christ, and hate your sins; who ask God to free you from them so that you may serve Him in true holiness and righteousness: Have no doubt that your prayers are sanctified by the sufferings of Jesus Christ, and therefore acceptable to God. I declare, according to the command of God, that from heaven you are released from all your sins (as Christ has promised in His Gospel), through the perfect satisfaction of the most holy passion and death of our Lord Jesus Christ. People of God, for Christ's sake, all your sins are forgiven. Therefore Lift up your hearts! We lift them up to the Lord. Sanctus How Shall We Then Live? (Please be seated) First Lesson Isaiah 42.14-21 I have held My peace a long time, I have been still and restrained Myself. Now I will cry like a woman in [a]labor, I will pant and gasp at once. 15 I will lay waste the mountains and hills, And dry up all their vegetation; I will make the rivers coastlands, And I will dry up the pools. 16 I will bring the blind by a way they did not know; I will lead them in paths they have not known. I will make darkness light before them, And crooked places straight. These things I will do for them, And not forsake them. 17 They shall be turned back, They shall be greatly ashamed, Who trust in carved images, Who say to the molded images, ‘You are our gods.' 18 Hear, you deaf; And look, you blind, that you may see. 19 Who is blind but My servant, Or deaf as My messenger whom I send? Who is blind as he who is perfect, And blind as the Lord's servant? 20 Seeing many things, but you do not observe; Opening the ears, but he does not hear. 21 The Lord is well pleased for His righteousness' sake; He will exalt the law and make it honorable. The Word of the Lord! Thanks be to God! Second Lesson Ephesians 5:8-14 8 For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Walk as children of light 9 (for the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness, righteousness, and truth), 10 finding out what is acceptable to the Lord. 11 And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather expose them. 12 For it is shameful even to speak of those things which are done by them in secret. 13 But all things that are exposed are made manifest by the light, for whatever makes manifest is light. 14 Therefore He says: Awake, you who sleep, Arise from the dead, And Christ will give you light.

SERMON Pastor Ben Rossell Ben Rossell Prayer of Consecration THE LORD COLLECTS OUR GIFTS Offertory I Heard the Voice of Jesus Say Presentation of Tithes and Offering LUKE 17:7-10 -- ""And which of you, having a servant plowing or tending sheep, will say to him when he has come in from the field, 'Come at once and sit down to eat'? But will he not rather say to him, 'Prepare something for my supper, and gird yourself and serve me till I have eaten and drunk, and afterward you will eat and drink'? Does he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded him? I think not. So likewise you, when you have done all those things which you are commanded, say, 'We are unprofitable servants. We have done what was our duty to do.' "" Our Gracious Heavenly Father, In bringing our gifts to You, we present our whole selves to you anew. We are living sacrifices for You.

Therefore, I invite all who are able to kneel, for a time of silent prayer and confession. We'll pray first silently, then unison. Let us pray together Almighty God, You have raised Your Son, Jesus, from death to life, and crowned Him Lord of all. We confess every way in which we have not bowed before Him, or acknowledged His rule in our lives. We confess where we have gone along with the ways of the world, and failed to give Him glory. Forgive us and raise us from sin, that we may be Your faithful people, obeying the commands of our Lord Jesus Christ, who rules the world and is Head of the Church, His Body. In His name we pray, Amen. * ASSURANCE OF FORGIVENESS Leader: Arise and hear good news . Romans 6 You have been buried with Jesus, by baptism into death, for this reason, so that just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, you also might walk in newness of life. Someone who's died has been set free from sin. We know that Christ, being raised from the dead, will never die again; death no longer has dominion over him. So you also must understand yourselves as dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus. 12 Therefore do not let sin rule in your still-mortal body; Do not let it make you obey its passions. 13 Do not make your bodily members available to sin, so that they become tools used for unrighteousness; instead, offer yourselves to God as one who's been brought from death to life, and make your bodily members available to God so that they become tools for righteousness. -- "" Almighty God, our heavenly Father, by raising His dear Son from the dead has declared to all the world that the final sacrifice has been made for sin the sacrifice of Jesus on the cross. To You who have been buried with Him in baptism; who walk after Him in new life; and who have confessed your sin today. God declares in the resurrection of Your Savior that all our sins are forgiven for Jesus' sake. Leader: Lift up your hearts! People: We lift them up to the Lord. Sanctus Holy, Holy, Holy THE LORD CONSECRATES US (Please be seated) First Lesson Acts 10:34-43 34 Then Peter opened his mouth and said: In truth I perceive that God shows no partiality. 35 But in every nation whoever fears Him and works righteousness is accepted by Him. 36 The word which God sent to the children of Israel, preaching peace through Jesus Christ He is Lord of all 37 that word you know, which was proclaimed throughout all Judea, and began from Galilee after the baptism which John preached: 38 how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power, who went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with Him. 39 And we are witnesses of all things which He did both in the land of the Jews and in Jerusalem, whom they killed by hanging on a tree. 40 Him God raised up on the third day, and showed Him openly, 41 not to all the people, but to witnesses chosen before by God, even to us who ate and drank with Him after He arose from the dead. 42 And He commanded us to preach to the people, and to testify that it is He who was ordained by God to be Judge of the living and the dead. 43 To Him all the prophets witness that, through His name, whoever believes in Him will receive remission of sins.

By Your Spirit unite us with the RESURRECTED and living Christ and with all who are baptized in His name, that we may be one in ministry in every place. As this bread is Christ's body for us, send us out to be the body of Christ in the world.

67,2023-04-16,"2nd LORD'S DAY OF EASTER APRIL 16, 2023 Arise and hear the good news [The angel of the Lord showed the prophet Zechariah 3] Joshua the high priest standing before the Angel of the Lord, and Satan standing at his right hand to oppose him. And the Lord said to Satan, ""The Lord rebuke you, Satan! The Lord who has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you! Is this not a brand plucked from the fire?"" Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and was standing before the Angel. Then He answered and spoke to those who stood before Him, saying, ""Take away the filthy garments from him."" And to him He said, ""See, I have removed your iniquity from you, and I will clothe you with rich robes."" And I said, ""Let them put a clean turban on his head."" So they put a clean turban on his head, and they put the clothes on him. And the Angel of the Lord stood by. [To all who confess their sin to God and seek His forgiveness through our great High Priest Jesus Christ, God rebukes the devil, the accuser, and plucks you as a brand from the burning, removes the filthy garments of your own righteousness, and clothes you with the rich robes of the righteousness of Christ. Beloved in the Lord, all your sins are forgiven for Jesus' sake!]. Therefore: Lift up your hearts! People: We lift them up to the Lord. THE LORD CONSECRATES US Sanctus (Please be seated) How shall we then live? Let us hear from the word of the Lord. How Shall We Then Live? First Lesson Acts 5:29-42 29 But Peter and the other apostles answered and said: We ought to obey God rather than men. 30 The God of our fathers raised up Jesus whom you murdered by hanging on a tree. 31 Him God has exalted to His right hand to be Prince and Savior, to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins. 32 And we are His witnesses to these things, and so also is the Holy Spirit whom God has given to those who obey Him. 33 When they heard this, they were furious and plotted to kill them. 34 Then one in the council stood up, a Pharisee named Gamaliel, a teacher of the law held in respect by all the people, and commanded them to put the apostles outside for a little while. 35 And he said to them: Men of Israel, take heed to yourselves what you intend to do regarding these men. 36 For some time ago Theudas rose up, claiming to be somebody. A number of men, about four hundred, joined him. He was slain, and all who obeyed him were scattered and came to nothing. 37 After this man, Judas of Galilee rose up in the days of the census, and drew away many people after him. He also perished, and all who obeyed him were dispersed. 38 And now I say to you, keep away from these men and let them alone; for if this plan or this work is of men, it will come to nothing; 39 but if it is of God, you cannot overthrow it lest you even be found to fight against God. 40 And they agreed with him, and when they had called for the apostles and beaten them, they commanded that they should not speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go. 41 So they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for His name. 42 And daily in the temple, and in every house, they did not cease teaching and preaching Jesus as the Christ. The Word of the Lord! Thanks be to God! Second Lesson 1 Peter 1:3-9 3 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His abundant mercy has begotten us again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, 4 to an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled and that does not fade away, reserved in heaven for you, 5 who are kept by the power of God through faith for salvation ready to be revealed in the last time. 6 In this you greatly rejoice, though now for a little while, if need be, you have been grieved by various trials, 7 that the genuineness of your faith, being much more precious than gold that perishes, though it is tested by fire, may be found to praise, honor, and glory at the revelation of Jesus Christ, 8 whom having not seen you love. Though now you do not see Him, yet believing, you rejoice with joy inexpressible and full of glory, 9 receiving the end of your faith the salvation of your souls. The Word of the Lord! Thanks be to God! (Now Rise for our Hymn) (Now Remain Standing for our Gospel Reading and song) [short] Gospel Lesson Matthew 6:5-9 The Gospel of the Kingdom! Praise be to the Lord Jesus Christ!

As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, unless it abides in the vine, neither can you, unless you abide in Me. I am the vine, you are the branches.

He makes me to lie down in green pastures; HE LEADS ME BESIDE THE STILL WATERS. He restores my soul; HE LEADS ME IN THE PATHS OF RIGHTEOUSNESS FOR HIS NAME'S SAKE. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I WILL FEAR NO EVIL; For You are with me; YOUR ROD AND STAFF, THEY COMFORT ME.

Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life; AND I WILL DWELL IN THE HOUSE OF THE LORD FOREVER. Rise and hear the good news of God's forgiveness. (1 Tim. 1:15) This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptance: that Christ Jesus came into the world in order to save sinners. Let everyone of us, together with the Apostle Paul, who wrote these words by the Holy Spirit, truly acknowledge this Scripture in our hearts. And so I declare by His Word, that each of you, who believes in Jesus' name, is loosed from your sins on earth and in heaven. And for Christ's sake, I proclaim unto you the forgiveness of all your sins. Therefore Lift up your hearts! People: We lift them up to the Lord. Holy, Holy, Holy Please be seated. First Lesson Acts 2:42-47 42 And they continued steadfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship, in the breaking of bread, and in prayers. 43 Then fear came upon every soul, and many wonders and signs were done through the apostles. 44 Now all who believed were together, and had all things in common, 45 and sold their possessions and goods, and divided them among all, as anyone had need. 46 So continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, they ate their food with gladness and simplicity of heart, 47 praising God and having favor with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily those who were being saved. The Word of the Lord! Thanks be to God! Second Lesson 1 Peter 2:19-25 19 For this is commendable, if because of conscience toward God one endures grief, suffering wrongfully. 20 For what credit is it if, when you are beaten for your faults, you take it patiently? But when you do good and suffer, if you take it patiently, this is commendable before God. 21 For to this you were called, because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that you should follow His steps: 22 Who committed no sin, Nor was deceit found in His mouth; 23 who, when He was reviled, did not revile in return; when He suffered, He did not threaten, but committed Himself to Him who judges righteously; 24 who Himself bore our sins in His own body on the tree, that we, having died to sins, might live for righteousness by whose stripes you were healed. 25 For you were like sheep going astray, but have now returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls.

Praise the Lord, O my soul! While I live, I will praise the Lord; I WILL SING PRAISES TO MY GOD WHILE I HAVE MY BEING. Do not put your trust in princes, NOR IN A SON OF MAN, IN WHOM THERE IS NO HELP. His spirit departs, he returns to his earth; IN THAT VERY DAY HIS PLANS PERISH. Happy is he who has the God of Jacob for his help, WHOSE HOPE IS IN THE LORD HIS GOD, Who made heaven and earth, The sea, and all that is in them; WHO KEEPS TRUTH FOREVER, WHO EXECUTES JUSTICE FOR THE OPPRESSED. Who gives food to the hungry. The Lord gives freedom to the prisoners. THE LORD OPENS THE EYES OF THE BLIND; THE LORD RAISES THOSE WHO ARE BOWED DOWN; The Lord loves the righteous.

First Lesson Acts 6:8-9; 7:51-60 8 And Stephen, full of faith and power, did great wonders and signs among the people. 9 Then there arose some from what is called the Synagogue of the Freedmen (Cyrenians, Alexandrians, and those from Cilicia and Asia), disputing with Stephen. (And Stephen said to them) 51 You stiff-necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears! You always resist the Holy Spirit; as your fathers did, so do you. 52 Which of the prophets did your fathers not persecute? And they killed those who foretold the coming of the Just One, of whom you now have become the betrayers and murderers, 53 who have received the law by the direction of angels and have not kept it. 54 When they heard these things they were cut to the heart, and they gnashed at him with their teeth. 55 But he, being full of the Holy Spirit, gazed into heaven and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God, 56 and said, Look! I see the heavens opened and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God! 57 Then they cried out with a loud voice, stopped their ears, and ran at him with one accord; 58 and they cast him out of the city and stoned him. And the witnesses laid down their clothes at the feet of a young man named Saul. 59 And they stoned Stephen as he was calling on God and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit. 60 Then he knelt down and cried out with a loud voice, Lord, do not charge them with this sin. And when he had said this, he fell asleep. The Word of the Lord! Thanks be to God! Second Lesson 1 Peter 2:2-10 2 as newborn babes, desire the pure milk of the word, that you may grow thereby, 3 if indeed you have tasted that the Lord is gracious. 4 Coming to Him as to a living stone, rejected indeed by men, but chosen by God and precious, 5 you also, as living stones, are being built up a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ. 6 Therefore it is also contained in the Scripture, Behold, I lay in Zion a chief cornerstone, elect, precious, And he who believes on Him will by no means be put to shame. 7 Therefore, to you who believe, He is precious; but to those who are disobedient, The stone which the builders rejected has become the chief cornerstone, 8 and A stone of stumbling and a rock of offense. They stumble, being disobedient to the word, to which they also were appointed. 9 But you are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, His own special people, that you may proclaim the praises of Him who called you out of darkness into His marvelous light; 10 who once were not a people but are now the people of God, who had not obtained mercy but now have obtained mercy.

THANKS BE TO GOD WHO HAS GIVEN US VICTORY THROUGH THE LORD JESUS CHRIST. AMEN! Christ, our Passover is sacrificed for us. THEREFORE, LET US KEEP THE FEAST. ALLELUIA! The Lord be with you! THE LORD BLESS YOU! AMEN! Entrance Psalm 66b Oh, bless our God, you peoples! AND MAKE THE VOICE OF HIS PRAISE TO BE HEARD, Who keeps our soul among the living, AND DOES NOT ALLOW OUR FEET TO BE MOVED. For You, O God, have tested us; YOU HAVE REFINED US AS SILVER IS REFINED. You brought us into the net; YOU LAID AFFLICTION ON OUR BACKS. You have caused men to ride over our heads; WE WENT THROUGH FIRE AND THROUGH WATER; BUT YOU BROUGHT US OUT TO RICH FULFILLMENT. I will go into Your house with burnt offerings; I WILL PAY YOU MY VOWS, Which my lips have uttered AND MY MOUTH HAS SPOKEN WHEN I WAS IN TROUBLE. I will offer You burnt sacrifices of fat animals, WITH THE SWEET AROMA OF RAMS; I WILL OFFER BULLS WITH GOATS. Come and hear, all you who fear God, AND I WILL DECLARE WHAT HE HAS DONE FOR MY SOUL. I cried to Him with my mouth, AND HE WAS EXTOLLED WITH MY TONGUE. If I regard iniquity in my heart, THE LORD WILL NOT HEAR. But certainly God has heard me; HE HAS ATTENDED TO THE VOICE OF MY PRAYER. Blessed be God, Who has not turned away my prayer, NOR HIS MERCY FROM ME! Jn 3.16,17 * Arise and hear the good news of God's FORGIVENESS Our Lord Jesus Christ says: For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him might not perish, but have everlasting life. For God sent not His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world, through Him, might be saved. Whoever believes in Him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God. Anyone present who persists in the love of sin, and refuses to repent from his shame, though their conscience convict them, I declare to you, by God's command, that His wrath and judgment abides upon you, and that all your sins are retained in heaven, and that you can never be delivered from eternal damnation, unless and until you repent. But, to every one of you beloved brothers and sisters, who abhor your sins, and resolve daily to turn from them and to serve the Lord in true holiness and righteousness; and believing in Him for the forgiveness of your sins I declare, according to God's command, that from heaven you are released from all your sins (as Christ has promised in His Gospel), through the perfect satisfaction of the most holy passion, death, and resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ. Beloved in the Lord, your sins are forgiven, Therefore, Lift up your hearts! People: We lift them up to the Lord. Holy, Holy, Holy Please be seated. How Shall We Then Live? Let us hear from God's Word. First Lesson Acts 17:16-31 16 Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was provoked within him when he saw that the city was given over to idols. 17 Therefore he reasoned in the synagogue with the Jews and with the Gentile worshipers, and in the marketplace daily with those who happened to be there. 18 Then certain Epicurean and Stoic philosophers encountered him. And some said, What does this babbler want to say? Others said, He seems to be a proclaimer of foreign gods, because he preached to them Jesus and the resurrection. 19 And they took him and brought him to the Areopagus, saying, May we know what this new doctrine is of which you speak? 20 For you are bringing some strange things to our ears. Therefore we want to know what these things mean. 21 For all the Athenians and the foreigners who were there spent their time in nothing else but either to tell or to hear some new thing. 22 Then Paul stood in the midst of the Areopagus and said, Men of Athens, I perceive that in all things you are very religious; 23 for as I was passing through and considering the objects of your worship, I even found an altar with this inscription: TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Therefore, the One whom you worship without knowing, Him I proclaim to you: 24 God, who made the world and everything in it, since He is Lord of heaven and earth, does not dwell in temples made with hands. 25 Nor is He worshiped with men's hands, as though He needed anything, since He gives to all life, breath, and all things. 26 And He has made from one blood every nation of men to dwell on all the face of the earth, and has determined their preappointed times and the boundaries of their dwellings, 27 so that they should seek the Lord, in the hope that they might grope for Him and find Him, though He is not far from each one of us; 28 for in Him we live and move and have our being, as also some of your own poets have said, ‘For we are also His offspring.' 29 Therefore, since we are the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Divine Nature is like gold or silver or stone, something shaped by art and man's devising. 30 Truly, these times of ignorance God overlooked, but now commands all men everywhere to repent, 31 because He has appointed a day on which He will judge the world in righteousness by the Man whom He has ordained. He has given assurance of this to all by raising Him from the dead. The Word of the Lord! Thanks be to God! Second Lesson 1 Peter 3:13-22 13 And who is he who will harm you if you become followers of what is good? 14 But even if you should suffer for righteousness' sake, you are blessed. And do not be afraid of their threats, nor be troubled. 15 But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts, and always be ready to give a defense to everyone who asks you a reason for the hope that is in you, with meekness and fear; 16 having a good conscience, that when they defame you as evildoers, those who revile your good conduct in Christ may be ashamed. 17 For it is better, if it is the will of God, to suffer for doing good than for doing evil. 18 For Christ also suffered once for sins, the just for the unjust, that He might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh but made alive by the Spirit, 19 by whom also He went and preached to the spirits in prison, 20 who formerly were disobedient, when once the Divine longsuffering waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was being prepared, in which a few, that is, eight souls, were saved through water. 21 There is also an antitype which now saves us baptism (not the removal of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God), through the resurrection of Jesus Christ, 22 who has gone into heaven and is at the right hand of God, angels and authorities and powers having been made subject to Him. The Word of the Lord! Thanks be to God! (Please rise for our hymn) (Please remain standing for our Gospel Reading and song) Gospel Lesson Matthew 6:10 The Gospel of the Kingdom!

72,2023-05-21,"SEVENTH SUNDAY OF EASTER May 13, 2018 HEB 4: Because we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession. 15 For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who in every respect has been tempted as we are, yet without sin. 16 Let us then with confidence draw near to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in our time of need. Christ is risen! He is risen indeed! Christ is risen from the dead. Alleluia! Thanks be to God who has given us victory through the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen! Christ, our Passover is sacrificed for us. Therefore, let us keep the feast. Alleluia! The Lord be with you! The Lord bless you! Amen! Entrance Psalm 68a Let God arise, Let His enemies be scattered; LET THOSE ALSO WHO HATE HIM FLEE BEFORE HIM. As smoke is driven away, So drive them away; As wax melts before the fire, SO LET THE WICKED PERISH AT THE PRESENCE OF GOD. But let the righteous be glad; Let them rejoice before God; YES, LET THEM REJOICE EXCEEDINGLY. Sing to God, sing praises to His name; Extol Him who rides on the clouds, HIS NAME IS YAHWEH, REJOICE BEFORE HIM. A father of the fatherless, a defender of widows, Is God in His holy habitation. God sets the solitary in families; HE BRINGS OUT THOSE WHO ARE BOUND INTO PROSPERITY; BUT THE REBELLIOUS DWELL IN A DRY LAND. O God, when You went out before Your people, When You marched through the wilderness, the earth shook; THE HEAVENS ALSO DROPPED RAIN AT THE PRESENCE OF GOD; SINAI ITSELF WAS MOVED AT THE PRESENCE OF GOD, THE GOD OF ISRAEL. You, O God, sent a plentiful rain, Whereby You confirmed Your inheritance, When it was weary. YOUR CONGREGATION DWELT IN IT; YOU, O GOD, PROVIDED FROM YOUR GOODNESS FOR THE POOR. Almighty and eternal God, We praise You for Your Son, our Savior, Who was taken up into Heaven Where He is even now at Your right hand in eternal glory, Interceding for us acting as our Advocate. We praise You for the Spirit Who abides in us as our Guide and Defender here. For You are the Great King over all the earth! You reign over the nations! You sit on the throne! And all the princes of the peoples gather to exalt You! Now hear us as we sing the prayer Your Son has given us: The Lord's Prayer (arr. Nikolai Kedrov) Our Father, who art in Heaven, Hallowed be Thy Name. Thy Kingdom Come. Thy will be done, on earth as it is in Heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, And forgive us our debts, as we forgive, our debtors. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For Thine is the Kingdom, and the Power, and the Glory. Forever and ever. Amen. CONFESSION OF SINS Saints of God, we are in need of cleansing and renewal. Let us call upon the mercy of our heavenly Father. Let us kneel and confess our sins together, in humble reliance upon the grace of God, first silently, then together. (Please Kneel) Let us pray together Almighty God, You have raised Your Son, Jesus, from death to life, and crowned Him Lord of all. We confess every way in which we have not bowed before Him, or acknowledged His rule in our lives. We confess where we have gone along with the ways of the world, and failed to give Him glory. Forgive us and raise us from sin, that we may be Your faithful people, obeying the commands of our Lord Jesus Christ, who rules the world and is Head of the Church, His Body. In His name we pray, Amen. Arise and hear the good news of God's forgiveness! ROM 8 (What does it mean that Christ has ascended and is seated at the Father's right hand?) He who did not spare His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not with Him also freely give us all things? Who shall bring a charge against God's elect? It is God who justifies. Who is he who condemns? It is Christ Jesus who died, yes, who was raised from the dead, Who is at the right hand of God, who indeed intercedes for us. Our heavenly father, in His great mercy, did not spare His own Son, but has delivered Him up for us all. He does not condemn you, but for Christ's sake forgives all your sins. Therefore,Lift up your hearts! People: We lift them up to the Lord! Sanctus Please be seated. How Shall We Then Live? Let us hear from God's Word. First Lesson Acts 1:1-11 The former account I made, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach, 2 until the day in which He was taken up, after He through the Holy Spirit had given commandments to the apostles whom He had chosen, 3 to whom He also presented Himself alive after His suffering by many infallible proofs, being seen by them during forty days and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God. 4 And being assembled together with them, He commanded them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for the Promise of the Father, which, He said, you have heard from Me; 5 for John truly baptized with water, but you shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now. 6 Therefore, when they had come together, they asked Him, saying, Lord, will You at this time restore the kingdom to Israel? 7 And He said to them, It is not for you to know times or seasons which the Father has put in His own authority. 8 But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you shall be witnesses to Me in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth. 9 Now when He had spoken these things, while they watched, He was taken up, and a cloud received Him out of their sight. 10 And while they looked steadfastly toward heaven as He went up, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel, 11 who also said, Men of Galilee, why do you stand gazing up into heaven? This same Jesus, who was taken up from you into heaven, will so come in like manner as you saw Him go into heaven. The Word of the Lord! Thanks be to God! Second Lesson Ephesians 1:15-23 15 Therefore I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all the saints, 16 do not cease to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers: 17 that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of Him, 18 the eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that you may know what is the hope of His calling, what are the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints, 19 and what is the exceeding greatness of His power toward us who believe, according to the working of His mighty power 20 which He worked in Christ when He raised Him from the dead and seated Him at His right hand in the heavenly places, 21 far above all principality and power and might and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this age but also in that which is to come. 22 And He put all things under His feet, and gave Him to be head over all things to the church, 23 which is His body, the fullness of Him who fills all in all. The Word of the Lord! Thanks be to God! (Now RISE for our Hymn) Psalm 2 (Now RISE for our Gospel Reading and song) Gospel Lesson Matthew 6:10b The Gospel of the Kingdom!

Amen. THE LORD COLLECTS OUR GIFTS Offertory Psalm 110 Presentation of Tithes and Offering GENESIS 28:20-22 -- Then Jacob made a vow, saying, ""If God will be with me, and keep me in this way that I am going, and give me bread to eat and clothing to put on, so that I come back to my father's house in peace, then the Lord shall be my God. And this stone which I have set as a pillar shall be God's house, and of all that You give me I will surely give a tenth to You."" Our Gracious Heavenly Father, Your people throughout every age have discovered what Jacob discovered in this passage: that while the idols of mankind are localized deities, changing from region to region, You are the one, true and living God, Who inhabits the Heavens as His throne and all the earth as Your footstool. Though we go to the uttermost parts of the earth, we find ourselves in Beth-el, - the house of God. For You are pleased to dwell in the midst of Your people, in every place, especially as they unite in worship. So gathered together this morning, like Jacob, we offer our tithes to You now. Receive and bless us and them for Jesus' sake. Amen. And Now Rise and let us pray together for the Church and the World Gracious Father, We thank You for Your precious promises declared to the human race in Your Son.

For Thine is the Kingdom, and the Power, and the Glory. Forever and ever. Amen. THE LORD CLEANSES US Saints of God, we are in need of cleansing and renewal. So I invite all who are able to kneel together with us as we begin our service with a time of silent prayer and confession of our sins. After that moment of silence, we'll join together for our corporate prayer of confession printed there in your bulletins. (Please Kneel) Let us pray together Almighty God, You have raised Your Son, Jesus, from death to life, and crowned Him Lord of all. We confess every way in which we have not bowed before Him, or acknowledged His rule in our lives. We confess where we have gone along with the ways of the world, and failed to give Him glory. Forgive us and raise us from sin, that we may be Your faithful people, obeying the commands of our Lord Jesus Christ, who rules the world and is Head of the Church, His Body. In His name we pray, Amen. (Please Stand) Arise and hear the good news of God's forgiveness! (Gal 4) When the fullness of time had come, God sent forth his Son, born of woman, born under the law, 5 to redeem those who were under the law, so that we might receive adoption as sons. 6 And because you are sons, God has sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, Abba! Father! 7 So you are no longer a slave, but a son, and if a son, then an heir through God. Our heavenly father, in His great mercy, first sent His own Son, and then sent His Spirit, so that we would no longer be slaves to sin and death, but sons of God and heirs together with Christ. To this the scars of Christ remain as a memorial in Heaven, and the Spirit of Christ remains in us as a Helper and Living Memorial on earth. So remember now, and rejoice in that the Father, for Christ's sake, has forgiven your sins. Therefore Lift up your hearts! People: We lift them up to the Lord. We lift them up to the Lord! Sanctus THE LORD CONSECRATES US Please be seated. First Lesson Acts 2: 1-21 When the Day of Pentecost had fully come, they were all together with one accord in one place. And suddenly there came a sound from heaven, as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting. Then there appeared to them tongues, as of fire, distributed and resting on each of them. And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance. And there were dwelling in Jerusalem Jews, devout men, from every nation under heaven. And when this sound occurred, the multitude came together, and were confused, because everyone heard them speak in his own language. Then they were all amazed and marveled, saying to one another: Look, are not all these who speak Galileans? And how is it that we hear, each in our own language in which we were born? Parthians and Medes and Elamites, those dwelling in Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia, Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya adjoining Cyrene, visitors from Rome, both Jews and proselytes, Cretans and Arabs we hear them speaking in our own tongues the wonderful works of God. So they were all amazed and perplexed, saying to one another, Whatever could this mean? Others mocking said, They are full of new wine. But Peter, standing up with the eleven, raised his voice and said to them, Men of Judea and all who dwell in Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and heed my words. For these are not drunk, as you suppose, since it is only the third hour of the day. But this is what was spoken by the prophet Joel: ‘And it shall come to pass in the last days, says God, That I will pour out of My Spirit on all flesh; Your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, Your young men shall see visions, Your old men shall dream dreams. And on My menservants and on My maidservants I will pour out My Spirit in those days; And they shall prophesy. I will show wonders in heaven above And signs in the earth beneath: Blood and fire and vapor of smoke. The sun shall be turned into darkness, And the moon into blood, Before the coming of the great and awesome day of the Lord. And it shall come to pass That whoever calls on the name of the Lord Shall be saved.' The Word of the Lord! Thanks be to God! Second Lesson: 2 Corinthians 3.3-11 3 clearly you are an epistle of Christ, ministered by us, written not with ink but by the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone but on tablets of flesh, that is, of the heart. 4 And we have such trust through Christ toward God. 5 Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think of anything as being from ourselves, but our sufficiency is from God, 6 who also made us sufficient as ministers of the new covenant, not of the letter but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life. 7 But if the ministry of death, written and engraved on stones, was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not look steadily at the face of Moses because of the glory of his countenance, which glory was passing away, 8 how will the ministry of the Spirit not be more glorious? 9 For if the ministry of condemnation had glory, the ministry of righteousness exceeds much more in glory. 10 For even what was made glorious had no glory in this respect, because of the glory that excels. 11 For if what is passing away was glorious, what remains is much more glorious. The Word of the Lord! Thanks be to God! (Now please rise for our hymn) (Please remain standing for our Gospel Reading and Song) Gospel Lesson John 7:37-39 37 On the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink. 38 He who believes in Me, as the Scripture has said, out of his heart will flow rivers of living water. 39 But this He spoke concerning the Spirit, whom those believing in Him would receive; for the Holy Spirit was not yet given, because Jesus was not yet glorified. The Gospel of the Kingdom! Praise be to the Lord Jesus Christ! The Gloria Patri Glory be to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Ghost! As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be. World without end. Amen, Amen! As the Church has prayed for many centuries on this day - Come, Holy Ghost, our souls inspire, and lighten with celestial fire. Teach us to know the Father, Son, and Yourself, the three in one in Jesus' name. Amen.

I believe in one God: the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth, and of all things visible and invisible; And in one Lord, Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son of God, begotten of His Father before all worlds, God of God, Light of Light, very God of very God, begotten, not made, being of one substance with the Father; by Whom all things were made; Who for us men, and for our salvation, came down from Heaven, and was incarnate by the Holy Ghost of the virgin, Mary, and was made man; and was crucified also for us under Pontius Pilate; He suffered, and was buried, and the third day He rose again according to the Scriptures; and ascended into Heaven, and sitteth at the right hand of the Father; and He shall come again with glory to judge both the quick and the dead; Whose kingdom shall have no end. And I believe in the Holy Ghost, the Lord and Giver of life, Who proceedeth from the Father and the Son; Who with the Father and the Son together is worshipped and glorified; Who spoke through the prophets. And I believe one, holy, catholic, and apostolic Church; I acknowledge one baptism for the remission of sins; and I look for the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come. Amen.

So I invite all who are able to kneel together with us as we begin our service with a time of silent prayer and confession of our sins. After that moment of silence, we'll join together for our corporate prayer of confession printed there in your bulletins. Let us pray together Lord God, eternal and almighty Father: We acknowledge before Your holy majesty that we are poor sinners, conceived and born in guilt and in corruption, prone to do evil, unable of our own power to do good. Because of our sin, we continually violate Your holy commandments. But, O Lord, with heartfelt sorrow we repent and turn away from all our offenses; asking for your grace to relieve our distress. Have compassion on us, most gracious God, Father of mercies, for the sake of Your son Jesus Christ our Lord. And in removing our guilt, also grant us daily increase of the grace of Your Holy Spirit, and produce in us the fruits of holiness and of righteousness pleasing in Your sight. Through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen. Rise! And hear Good News . Romans 8 * ASSURANCE OF FORGIVENESS The Spirit helps us in our weakness. For we do not know what to pray for as we ought, but the Spirit Himself intercedes for us with groanings too deep for words. And he who searches hearts knows what is the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for the saints according to the will of God. And we know that for those who love God all things work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose. For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, in order that he might be the firstborn among many brothers. To you who have confessed your sins and asked God's mercy in Jesus' name, for you The Spirit intercedes along with the Son in Whose image you are being remade and The Father declares that if He did not withhold His Own Son, He will not withhold Forgiveness of your sins nor any gracious gift. People of God for Christ's sake all your sins are forgiven. Therefore - Leader: Lift up your hearts! We lift them up to the Lord! Sanctus Holy, Holy, Holy! THE LORD CONSECRATES US (Please be seated) How shall we then live? Let us hear from God's Word: First Lesson Genesis 1:1-2:4 1 In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. 2 The earth was without form, and void; and darkness [a]was on the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters. 3 Then God said, Let there be light; and there was light. 4 And God saw the light, that it was good; and God divided the light from the darkness. 5 God called the light Day, and the darkness He called Night. [b]So the evening and the morning were the first day. 6 Then God said, Let there be a [c]firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters. 7 Thus God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament; and it was so. 8 And God called the firmament Heaven. So the evening and the morning were the second day. 9 Then God said, Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together into one place, and let the dry land appear; and it was so. 10 And God called the dry land Earth, and the gathering together of the waters He called Seas. And God saw that it was good. 11 Then God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb that yields seed, and the fruit tree that yields fruit according to its kind, whose seed is in itself, on the earth; and it was so. 12 And the earth brought forth grass, the herb that yields seed according to its kind, and the tree that yields fruit, whose seed is in itself according to its kind. And God saw that it was good. 13 So the evening and the morning were the third day. 14 Then God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heavens to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs and seasons, and for days and years; 15 and let them be for lights in the firmament of the heavens to give light on the earth; and it was so. 16 Then God made two great [d]lights: the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night. He made the stars also. 17 God set them in the firmament of the heavens to give light on the earth, 18 and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness. And God saw that it was good. 19 So the evening and the morning were the fourth day. 20 Then God said, Let the waters abound with an abundance of living [e]creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the face of the [f]firmament of the heavens. 21 So God created great sea creatures and every living thing that moves, with which the waters abounded, according to their kind, and every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that it was good. 22 And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth. 23 So the evening and the morning were the fifth day. 24 Then God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature according to its kind: cattle and creeping thing and beast of the earth, each according to its kind; and it was so. 25 And God made the beast of the earth according to its kind, cattle according to its kind, and everything that creeps on the earth according to its kind. And God saw that it was good. 26 Then God said, Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness; let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the air, and over the cattle, over [g]all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth. 27 So God created man in His own image; in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them. 28 Then God blessed them, and God said to them, Be fruitful and multiply; fill the earth and subdue it; have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the air, and over every living thing that [h]moves on the earth. 29 And God said, See, I have given you every herb that yields seed which is on the face of all the earth, and every tree whose fruit yields seed; to you it shall be for food. 30 Also, to every beast of the earth, to every bird of the air, and to everything that creeps on the earth, in which there is [i]life, I have given every green herb for food; and it was so. 31 Then God saw everything that He had made, and indeed it was very good. So the evening and the morning were the sixth day. 2 Thus the heavens and the earth, and all the host of them, were finished. 2 And on the seventh day God ended His work which He had done, and He rested on the seventh day from all His work which He had done. 3 Then God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it, because in it He rested from all His work which God had created and made. 4 This is the [j]history of the heavens and the earth when they were created, in the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens, The Word of the Lord! Thanks be to God! Second Lesson Acts 2:14a; 22-36 14 But Peter, standing up with the eleven, raised his voice and said to them , 22 Men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus of Nazareth, a Man attested by God to you by miracles, wonders, and signs which God did through Him in your midst, as you yourselves also know 23 Him, being delivered by the determined purpose and foreknowledge of God, you [a]have taken by lawless hands, have crucified, and put to death; 24 whom God raised up, having [b]loosed the [c]pains of death, because it was not possible that He should be held by it. 25 For David says concerning Him: ‘I foresaw the Lord always before my face, For He is at my right hand, that I may not be shaken. 26 Therefore my heart rejoiced, and my tongue was glad; Moreover my flesh also will rest in hope. 27 For You will not leave my soul in Hades, Nor will You allow Your Holy One to see corruption. 28 You have made known to me the ways of life; You will make me full of joy in Your presence.' 29 Men and brethren, let me speak freely to you of the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his tomb is with us to this day. 30 Therefore, being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him that of the fruit of his body, [d]according to the flesh, He would raise up the Christ to sit on his throne, 31 he, foreseeing this, spoke concerning the resurrection of the Christ, that His soul was not left in Hades, nor did His flesh see corruption. 32 This Jesus God has raised up, of which we are all witnesses. 33 Therefore being exalted [e]to the right hand of God, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, He poured out this which you now see and hear. 34 For David did not ascend into the heavens, but he says himself: ‘The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at My right hand, 35 Till I make Your enemies Your footstool. ' 36 Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God has made this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Christ. The Word of the Lord! Thanks be to God!

Let us pray together Lord God, eternal and almighty Father: We acknowledge before your holy majesty that we are poor sinners, conceived and born in guilt and in corruption, prone to do evil, unable of our own power to do good. Because of our sin, we endlessly violate your holy commandments. But, O Lord, with heartfelt sorrow we repent and turn away from all our offenses; asking for your grace to relieve our distress. Have compassion on us, most gracious God, Father of mercies, for the sake of your son Jesus Christ our Lord.

First Lesson Exodus 19:2-8 2 For they had departed from Rephidim, had come to the Wilderness of Sinai, and camped in the wilderness. So Israel camped there before the mountain. 3 And Moses went up to God, and the Lord called to him from the mountain, saying, Thus you shall say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel: 4 ‘You have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and how I bore you on eagles' wings and brought you to Myself. 5 Now therefore, if you will indeed obey My voice and keep My covenant, then you shall be a special treasure to Me above all people; for all the earth is Mine. 6 And you shall be to Me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.' These are the words which you shall speak to the children of Israel. 7 So Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and laid before them all these words which the Lord commanded him. 8 Then all the people answered together and said, All that the Lord has spoken we will do. So Moses brought back the words of the people to the Lord. The Word of the Lord! Thanks be to God! Second Lesson Romans 5:6-15 6 For when we were still without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly. 7 For scarcely for a righteous man will one die; yet perhaps for a good man someone would even dare to die. 8 But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. 9 Much more then, having now been justified by His blood, we shall be saved from wrath through Him. 10 For if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved by His life. 11 And not only that, but we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received the reconciliation. 12 Therefore, just as through one man sin entered the world, and death through sin, and thus death spread to all men, because all sinned 13 (For until the law sin was in the world, but sin is not imputed when there is no law. 14 Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over those who had not sinned according to the likeness of the transgression of Adam, who is a type of Him who was to come. 15 But the free gift is not like the [b]offense. For if by the one man's offense many died, much more the grace of God and the gift by the grace of the one Man, Jesus Christ, abounded to many. The Word of the Lord! Thanks be to God!

Then all the craftsmen who were doing all the work of the sanctuary came, each from the work he was doing, and they spoke to Moses, saying, ""The people bring much more than enough for the service of the work which the Lord commanded us to do."" So Moses gave a commandment, and they caused it to be proclaimed throughout the camp, saying, ""Let neither man nor woman do any more work for the offering of the sanctuary."" And the people were restrained from bringing, for the material they had was sufficient for all the work to be done -- indeed too much. Our Gracious Heavenly Father, by Your Holy Spirit, grant Your Church true grace and devotion that She may support Your work with sacrificial abundance, as the people of Israel gave for the Tabernacle in the wilderness.

First Lesson Jeremiah 20:7-13 7 O Lord, You induced me, and I was persuaded; You are stronger than I, and have prevailed. I am in derision daily; everyone mocks me. 8 For when I spoke, I cried out; I shouted, Violence and plunder! Because the word of the Lord was made to me A reproach and a derision daily. 9 Then I said, I will not make mention of Him, Nor speak anymore in His name. But His word was in my heart like a burning fire Shut up in my bones; I was weary of holding it back, and I could not. 10 For I heard many mocking: Fear on every side! Report, they say, and we will report it! All my acquaintances watched for my stumbling, saying, Perhaps he can be induced; Then we will prevail against him, And we will take our revenge on him. 11 But the Lord is with me as a mighty, awesome One. Therefore my persecutors will stumble, and will not prevail. They will be greatly ashamed, for they will not prosper. Their everlasting confusion will never be forgotten. 12 But, O Lord of hosts, You who test the righteous, And see the mind and heart, Let me see Your vengeance on them; for I have pleaded my cause before You. 13 Sing to the Lord! Praise the Lord! For He has delivered the life of the poor from the hand of evildoers. The Word of the Lord! Thanks be to God! Second Lesson Romans 6:12-23 12 Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body, that you should obey it in its lusts. 13 And do not present your members as instruments of unrighteousness to sin, but present yourselves to God as being alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness to God. 14 For sin shall not have dominion over you, for you are not under law but under grace. 15 What then? Shall we sin because we are not under law but under grace? Certainly not! 16 Do you not know that to whom you present yourselves slaves to obey, you are that one's slaves whom you obey, whether of sin leading to death, or of obedience leading to righteousness? 17 But God be thanked that though you were slaves of sin, yet you obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine to which you were delivered. 18 And having been set free from sin, you became slaves of righteousness. 19 I speak in human terms because of the weakness of your flesh. For just as you presented your members as slaves of uncleanness, and of lawlessness leading to more lawlessness, so now present your members as slaves of righteousness for holiness. 20 For when you were slaves of sin, you were free in regard to righteousness. 21 What fruit did you have then in the things of which you are now ashamed? For the end of those things is death. 22 But now having been set free from sin, and having become slaves of God, you have your fruit to holiness, and the end, everlasting life. 23 For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.

77,2023-07-02,"FIFTH SUNDAY AFTER PENTECOST-JULY 10, 2022 PSALM 149 - Praise the Lord! Sing unto the Lord a new song! Sing His praise in the congregation of the Saints! For the Lord takes pleasure in His people. He will beautify the meek with salvation! In the name of God the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, rise and worship. I rejoiced when they said to me, Let us go into the house of the Lord! OUR FEET ARE STANDING WITHIN YOUR GATES, O JERUSALEM! Our help is in the name of the Lord! MAKER OF HEAVEN AND EARTH. Entrance Entrance Psalm 119:153-160 Consider my affliction and deliver me, FOR I DO NOT FORGET YOUR LAW. Plead my cause and redeem me; REVIVE ME ACCORDING TO YOUR WORD. Salvation is far from the wicked, FOR THEY DO NOT SEEK YOUR STATUTES. Great are Your tender mercies, O LORD; REVIVE ME ACCORDING TO YOUR JUDGMENTS. Many are my persecutors and my enemies, YET I DO NOT TURN FROM YOUR TESTIMONIES. I see the treacherous, and am disgusted, BECAUSE THEY DO NOT KEEP YOUR WORD. Consider how I love Your precepts; REVIVE ME, O LORD, ACCORDING TO YOUR LOVINGKINDNESS. The entirety of Your word is truth, AND EVERY ONE OF YOUR RIGHTEOUS JUDGMENTS ENDURES FOREVER. Entrance Hymn Beneath the Blood-stained Lintel Baptism of Jesse Cambron Griffiths Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one! You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your strength. And these words which I command you today shall be in your heart. You shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in your house, when you walk by the way, when you lie down, and when you rise up For the promise is to you and to your children, and to all who are afar off, as many as the Lord our God will call. (Deut 6:4-7; Acts 2:39). DEARLY BELOVED, the sacrament of baptism is for little children because God our Father, Who has redeemed us by the sacrifice of Christ, is also the God and Father of our children. They belong, with us who believe, to the membership of the Church through the covenant made with Christ. Our own Westminster Confession of Faith says that baptism is a sign and seal of the covenant of grace, of our ingrafting into Christ, of regeneration, of remission of sins, and of our giving up unto God, through Jesus Christ, to walk in the newness of life. Our Lord Jesus said, Allow the little children to come unto Me, and do not forbid them, for of such is the kingdom of God. Jacob and Anna, is Jesus Christ your only Lord and Savior? You know that, in presenting your son, that God requires things of you 1. In presenting your son for baptism, you are acknowledging your need and his of the cleansing blood of Jesus Christ and the renewing grace of the Holy Spirit. 2. You are claiming God's covenant promise in his behalf, God's promise to be a God to you and to your descendants after you, and you are looking in faith to the Lord Jesus Christ for his salvation, as you do for your own. 3. You are now unreservedly committing him to God, and promising, in humble reliance upon divine grace, that you will endeavor to set before him a Godly example, that you will pray with and for her, that you will teach him the doctrines of the Christian faith, and that you will strive, by all the means of God's appointment, to bring him up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord. These are the baptismal duties God requires of you do you vow to obey Him by His grace and help? [response: We do] QUESTION TO THE CONGREGATION: God calls you as the Body of Christ to assist these parents in the Christian nurture of this child? Will you respond with a hearty Amen and commit to undertake this responsibility by God's grace and help? AMEN What is this child's name? Jesse Cambron, I BAPTIZE YOU IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER AND THE SON AND THE HOLY SPIRIT. THE BLESSINGS OF THE TRIUNE GOD BE WITH YOU ALWAYS. Little boy, for you Jesus Christ came into the world, suffered and did battle. For you He faced the blackness of Gethsemane and the terrors of Calvary. For you He cried out It is finished! For you He overcame death by death, was buried, and ascended into Heaven, where for you, He is right now, interceding. All these things while you are too young to even know what they mean. And so the word of the Apostle is confirmed: We love Him because first, He loved us. DECLARATION: This child, being thus baptized, is a member of the household of faith; committed to the care and instruction of these parents and this congregation, to the end that he may mature and grow strong as a disciple of the Lord Jesus Christ, and serve in the royal priesthood of God's elect from every tribe and tongue and nation. Jesus said, Whoever receives one such little child in My name, receives Me. And to all you who have been baptized improve and make right use of your baptism, stir up your faith; nurture it; feed it; exercise it; strengthen it and always be repenting of any sins against your covenant with God for there is a covenant sealed by your baptism betwixt God and your soul. Never forget it. It is a great honor and gift to belong to God in this way. Please rise for our prayer of blessing which we will close together by singing of the Lord's Prayer: Eternal and Almighty God, You righteously judged the unfaithful world through flood waters, but in Your great mercy, saved faithful Noah with his household. You drowned hard-hearted Pharaoh with all his army in the Sea, but led Your people Israel through on dry ground, prefiguring the washing of Your holy baptism. By the baptism of Your dear Son, You sanctified and set apart the Jordan River and all water for a saving flood, and an ample washing away of sins. Through Your same infinite mercy, graciously look down now upon Jesse, and bless him with a right faith in the Spirit, so that through this saving flood all that was born in him from Adam and all that has been added to it might be drowned and cleansed. Separate him now from the unfaithful, and preserve him in the holy ark of Christendom dry and safe, ever fervent in spirit and joyful in hope to serve Your holy name, so that he, together with us and all Your Faithful, may worthily inherit Your promise of eternal life, through Christ Jesus our Lord. Now hear us as we sing the prayer He taught us: *Prayer of Adoration and Lord's Prayer Praise waits for You among Your people, Heavenly Father, and we are glad to bring it along with our offerings and ourselves. We rejoice to gather before You together with all Your people throughout all the world. Truly to You all flesh shall come. How blessed is anyone You choose and cause to approach Yourself. We praise You for calling us to dwell in Your courts that we might be satisfied with the goodness of Your Son, Jesus our Lord, Who is the confidence of all the ends of the earth. Now hear us as we sing the prayer He has taught us:.. The Lord's Prayer (arr. Nikolai Kedrov) Our Father, who art in Heaven, Hallowed be Thy Name. Thy Kingdom Come. Thy will be done, on earth as it is in Heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, And forgive us our debts, as we forgive, our debtors. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For Thine is the Kingdom, and the Power, and the Glory. Forever and ever. Amen. THE LORD CLEANSES US Saints of God, we are in need of cleansing and renewal. Let us call upon the mercy of our heavenly Father. Let us kneel and confess our sins together, in humble reliance upon the grace of God, first silently, then together. Let us pray together BULLETIN Arise! and hear the good news of God's forgiveness! [The Lord said to Israel]: I will pass through the land of Egypt on that night, and will strike all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment: I am the Lord. Now the blood shall be a sign for you on the houses where you are. And when I see the blood, I will pass over you; and the plague shall not be on you to destroy you when I strike the land of Egypt . [To you, covenant people, whose homes are marked by the blood of the Lamb, and whose very bodies are marked by the water of baptism, God declares that in Christ - your sins are forgiven and that the righteous judgment which falls on the wicked will not fall on you]. Lift up your hearts! We lift them up to the Lord! Please be seated. How Shall We Then Live? Let us hear from God's Word. First Lesson Jeremiah 28:5-9 5 Then the prophet Jeremiah spoke to the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests and in the presence of all the people who stood in the house of the Lord, 6 and the prophet Jeremiah said, Amen! The Lord do so; the Lord perform your words which you have prophesied, to bring back the vessels of the Lord's house and all who were carried away captive, from Babylon to this place. 7 Nevertheless hear now this word that I speak in your hearing and in the hearing of all the people: 8 The prophets who have been before me and before you of old prophesied against many countries and great kingdoms of war and disaster and pestilence. 9 As for the prophet who prophesies of peace, when the word of the prophet comes to pass, the prophet will be known as one whom the Lord has truly sent. The Word of the Lord! Thanks be to God! Second Lesson Romans 7:1-13 7 Or do you not know, brethren (for I speak to those who know the law), that the law has dominion over a man as long as he lives? 2 For the woman who has a husband is bound by the law to her husband as long as he lives. But if the husband dies, she is released from the law of her husband. 3 So then if, while her husband lives, she marries another man, she will be called an adulteress; but if her husband dies, she is free from that law, so that she is no adulteress, though she has married another man. 4 Therefore, my brethren, you also have become dead to the law through the body of Christ, that you may be married to another to Him who was raised from the dead, that we should bear fruit to God. 5 For when we were in the flesh, the sinful passions which were aroused by the law were at work in our members to bear fruit to death. 6 But now we have been delivered from the law, having died to what we were held by, so that we should serve in the newness of the Spirit and not in the oldness of the letter. 7 What shall we say then? Is the law sin? Certainly not! On the contrary, I would not have known sin except through the law. For I would not have known covetousness unless the law had said, You shall not covet. 8 But sin, taking opportunity by the commandment, produced in me all manner of evil desire. For apart from the law sin was dead. 9 I was alive once without the law, but when the commandment came, sin revived and I died. 10 And the commandment, which was to bring life, I found to bring death. 11 For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it killed me. 12 Therefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy and just and good. 13 Has then what is good become death to me? Certainly not! But sin, that it might appear sin, was producing death in me through what is good, so that sin through the commandment might become exceedingly sinful. The Word of the Lord! Thanks be to God! (Please RISE for our Hymn) Ps 84 (Please remain standing for our Gospel Reading and song) Gospel Lesson Matthew 6:13b The Gospel of the Kingdom! Praise be to the Lord Jesus Christ!

So help us by Your Spirit to come to Him once more, for we pray in His strong and holy name. Amen. Nicene Creed Christians, in Whom do you trust? I believe in one God: the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth, and of all things visible and invisible; And in one Lord, Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son of God, begotten of His Father before all worlds, God of God, Light of Light, very God of very God, begotten, not made, being of one substance with the Father; by Whom all things were made; Who for us men, and for our salvation, came down from Heaven, and was incarnate by the Holy Ghost of the virgin, Mary, and was made man; and was crucified also for us under Pontius Pilate; He suffered, and was buried, and the third day He rose again according to the Scriptures; and ascended into Heaven, and sitteth at the right hand of the Father; and He shall come again with glory to judge both the quick and the dead; Whose kingdom shall have no end. And I believe in the Holy Ghost, the Lord and Giver of life, Who proceedeth from the Father and the Son; Who with the Father and the Son together is worshipped and glorified; Who spoke through the prophets. And I believe one, holy, catholic, and apostolic Church; I acknowledge one baptism for the remission of sins; and I look for the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come. Amen.

For what I will to do, that I do not practice; but what I hate, that I do. 16 If, then, I do what I will not to do, I agree with the law that it is good. 17 But now, it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells in me. 18 For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh) nothing good dwells; for to will is present with me, but how to perform what is good I do not find. 19 For the good that I will to do, I do not do; but the evil I will not to do, that I practice. 20 Now if I do what I will not to do, it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells in me. 21 I find then a law, that evil is present with me, the one who wills to do good. 22 For I delight in the law of God according to the inward man. 23 But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members. 24 O wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from this body of death? 25 I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord! The Word of the Lord! Thanks be to God!

I believe in one God: the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth, and of all things visible and invisible; And in one Lord, Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son of God, begotten of His Father before all worlds, God of God, Light of Light, very God of very God, begotten, not made, being of one substance with the Father; by Whom all things were made; Who for us men, and for our salvation, came down from Heaven, and was incarnate by the Holy Ghost of the virgin, Mary, and was made man; and was crucified also for us under Pontius Pilate; He suffered, and was buried, and the third day He rose again according to the Scriptures; and ascended into Heaven, and sitteth at the right hand of the Father; and He shall come again with glory to judge both the quick and the dead; Whose kingdom shall have no end. And I believe in the Holy Ghost, the Lord and Giver of life, Who proceedeth from the Father and the Son; Who with the Father and the Son together is worshipped and glorified; Who spoke through the prophets.

OUR FEET ARE STANDING WITHIN YOUR GATES, O JERUSALEM! Our help is in the name of the Lord! MAKER OF HEAVEN AND EARTH. Entrance Psalm 65:1-8 Praise is awaiting You, O God, in Zion; AND TO YOU THE VOW SHALL BE PERFORMED. O You who hear prayer, TO YOU ALL FLESH WILL COME. Iniquities prevail against me; AS FOR OUR TRANSGRESSIONS, YOU WILL PROVIDE ATONEMENT FOR THEM. Blessed is the man You choose, AND CAUSE TO APPROACH YOU, THAT HE MAY DWELL IN YOUR COURTS. We shall be satisfied with the goodness of Your house, OF YOUR HOLY TEMPLE. By awesome deeds in righteousness You will answer us, O GOD OF OUR SALVATION, You who are the confidence of all the ends of the earth, AND OF THE FAR-OFF SEAS; Who established the mountains by His strength, BEING CLOTHED WITH POWER; You who still the noise of the seas, THE NOISE OF THEIR WAVES, AND THE TUMULT OF THE PEOPLES.

Entrance Hymn Arise, My Soul, Arise INSTALLATION OF SAM NELSON Ephesians 4 When He ascended on high, He led captivity captive, And gave gifts to men. 9 (Now this, He ascended what does it mean but that He also [d]first descended into the lower parts of the earth? 10 He who descended is also the One who ascended far above all the heavens, that He might fill all things.) 11 And He Himself gave some to be apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, and some pastors and teachers, 12 for the equipping of the saints for the work of ministry, for the [e]edifying of the body of Christ, 13 till we all come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a perfect man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ; Our TPC Constitution states that the office of Ruling Elder is one of service and rule. Ruling elders colabor with Teaching elders (pastors) in shepherding the flock as members of the same Session they may serve together as representatives of this church in Presbytery and council meetings and in times of necessity they help with pastoral duties (such as administration of the sacraments). According to Scripture, those who bear the office of Ruling Elder should be blameless in life, sound in the faith, wise in the things of God, and discreet in all things. Together, the Elders watch over the spiritual welfare of the congregation. So it is the first duty of the Ruling Elder to seek and represent the mind of Christ. As the law of love places Christian duties upon every believer, the Ruling Elder is especially bound to fulfill those duties and to be an example to all. This morning, our business is to INSTALL rather than ORDAIN Sam to this office, because, as our Constitution notes, When a man has already been ordained to office , he is installed, rather than re-ordained. 1. Do you believe the Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments, as originally given, to be the inerrant Word of God, the only infallible rule of faith and practice? 2. Do you sincerely receive the Westminster Confession of Faith as containing the system of doctrine taught in the Holy Scriptures, aside from your stated exceptions; and do you further promise that if at any time you find yourself out of accord with any of the fundamentals of this system of doctrine, you will, on your own initiative, make it known to your Session? 3. Do you approve of the form of government and discipline of this church and promise subjection to your brethren in the Lord? 4. Are you now willing to take responsibility in the life of this congregation as a Ruling Elder, and will you seek to discharge your duties, relying upon the grace of God, walking with exemplary piety before this congregation of which God will make you an officer and in such a way that the entire Church of Jesus Christ will be blessed? 5. Do you promise to strive for the purity, peace, unity and edification of the church? LET US PRAY: Lord, it is You Who choose men to minister as gifts to Your church. Thank You for doing this, for apart from You, we can do nothing. As You have called Sam by Your Spirit and through Your providence, give him the strength to accomplish the responsibilities he accepts today as a ruling elder in this church. As our elder, grant him wisdom and grace. In his home, grant faithfulness and love grant Barbara extra measures of patience and grace in the many sacrifices to which she will be called as the wife of an elder. Bless that ministry with Your strength and make it an effective witnesses of Your gospel in our community day by day. The fruit of Your Spirit is: love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, and self-control. O Lord, sanctify and empower our brother for this task, through the power of the Holy Spirit. In Jesus' name. AMEN. We give you the right hand of fellowship, to take part in this office with us. The minister shall then say: I now pronounce and declare that Sam Nelson has been appointed, ordained, and installed as an elder in this church, agreeable to the Word of God, and according to the Constitution of this congregation and the Communion of Reformed and Evangelical Churches; As your ruling elder, I call upon each of you to yield to him all the honor, encouragement, and obedience in the Lord to which he is now entitled by this office according to the Word of God and the Constitution of this church.

This saying is true and we should believe it: that Christ Jesus came into the world to rescue sinners. He himself bore our sins in his body on the cross, that we might be dead to sin and alive to all that is good. To You who repent and believe in Him, I proclaim to you the forgiveness of your sins, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. therefore Lift up your hearts!

First Lesson Isaiah 55:10-13 For as the rain comes down, and the snow from heaven, And do not return there, But water the earth, And make it bring forth and bud, That it may give seed to the sower And bread to the eater, 11 So shall My word be that goes forth from My mouth; It shall not return to Me void, But it shall accomplish what I please, And it shall prosper in the thing for which I sent it. 12 For you shall go out with joy, And be led out with peace; The mountains and the hills Shall break forth into singing before you, And all the trees of the field shall clap their hands. 13 Instead of the thorn shall come up the cypress tree, And instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle tree; And it shall be to the Lord for a name, For an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off. The Word of the Lord! Thanks be to God! Second Lesson Romans 8:12-17 12 Therefore, brethren, we are debtors not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh. 13 For if you live according to the flesh you will die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live. 14 For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God. 15 For you did not receive the spirit of bondage again to fear, but you received the Spirit of adoption by whom we cry out, Abba, Father. 16 The Spirit Himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God, 17 and if children, then heirs heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ, if indeed we suffer with Him, that we may also be glorified together.

First Lesson Genesis 14:5-24 20 In the fourteenth year Chedorlaomer and the kings that were with him came and attacked the Rephaim in Ashteroth Karnaim, the Zuzim in Ham, the Emim in Shaveh Kiriathaim, and the Horites in their mountain of Seir, as far as El Paran, which is by the wilderness. Then they turned back and came to En Mishpat (that is, Kadesh), and attacked all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites who dwelt in Hazezon Tamar. And the king of Sodom, the king of Gomorrah, the king of Admah, the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar) went out and joined together in battle in the Valley of Siddim against Chedorlaomer king of Elam, Tidal king of nations, Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar four kings against five. Now the Valley of Siddim was full of asphalt pits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled; some fell there, and the remainder fled to the mountains. Then they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their provisions, and went their way. They also took Lot, Abram's brother's son who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed. Then one who had escaped came and told Abram the Hebrew, for he dwelt by the terebinth trees of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol and brother of Aner; and they were allies with Abram. Now when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his three hundred and eighteen trained servants who were born in his own house, and went in pursuit as far as Dan. He divided his forces against them by night, and he and his servants attacked them and pursued them as far as Hobah, which is north of Damascus. So he brought back all the goods, and also brought back his brother Lot and his goods, as well as the women and the people. And the king of Sodom went out to meet him at the Valley of Shaveh (that is, the King's Valley), after his return from the defeat of Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him. Then Melchizedek king of Salem brought out bread and wine; he was the priest of God Most High. And he blessed him and said: ​ ​​ Blessed be Abram of God Most High, ​​Possessor of heaven and earth; ​​And blessed be God Most High, ​​Who has delivered your enemies into your hand. ​ And he gave him a tithe of all. The Word of the Lord! Thanks be to God! Second Lesson Malachi 3:1-12 1 Behold, I send My messenger, And he will prepare the way before Me. And the Lord, whom you seek, Will suddenly come to His temple, Even the Messenger of the covenant, In whom you delight. Behold, He is coming, Says the Lord of hosts. 2 But who can endure the day of His coming? And who can stand when He appears? For He is like a refiner's fire And like launderers' soap. 3 He will sit as a refiner and a purifier of silver; He will purify the sons of Levi, And purge them as gold and silver, That they may offer to the Lord An offering in righteousness. 4 Then the offering of Judah and Jerusalem Will be pleasant to the Lord, As in the days of old, As in former years. 5 And I will come near you for judgment; I will be a swift witness Against sorcerers, Against adulterers, Against perjurers, Against those who exploit wage earners and widows and orphans, And against those who turn away an alien Because they do not fear Me, Says the Lord of hosts. 6 For I am the Lord, I do not change; Therefore you are not consumed, O sons of Jacob. 7 Yet from the days of your fathers You have gone away from My ordinances And have not kept them. Return to Me, and I will return to you, Says the Lord of hosts. But you said, ‘In what way shall we return?' 8 Will a man rob God? Yet you have robbed Me! But you say, ‘In what way have we robbed You?' In tithes and offerings. 9 You are cursed with a curse, For you have robbed Me, Even this whole nation. 10 Bring all the tithes into the storehouse, That there may be food in My house, And try Me now in this, Says the Lord of hosts, If I will not open for you the windows of heaven And pour out for you such blessing That there will not be room enough to receive it. 11 And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, So that he will not destroy the fruit of your ground, Nor shall the vine fail to bear fruit for you in the field, Says the Lord of hosts; 12 And all nations will call you blessed, For you will be a delightful land, Says the Lord of hosts. The Word of the Lord! Thanks be to God! (Please rise for our Epistle Hymn, Come, Thou Fount of Every Blessing ) (Please remain standing for our Gospel Lesson and song) Gospel Lesson Mark 12:38-44 38 Then He said to them in His teaching, Beware of the scribes, who desire to go around in long robes, love greetings in the marketplaces, 39 the best seats in the synagogues, and the best places at feasts, 40 who devour widows' houses, and for a pretense make long prayers. These will receive greater condemnation. 41 Now Jesus sat opposite the treasury and saw how the people put money into the treasury. And many who were rich put in much. 42 Then one poor widow came and threw in two mites, which make a quadrans. 43 So He called His disciples to Himself and said to them, Assuredly, I say to you that this poor widow has put in more than all those who have given to the treasury; 44 for they all put in out of their abundance, but she out of her poverty put in all that she had, her whole livelihood.

Our Gracious Heavenly Father, Deliver us from every decadent presumption and forgetful ingratitude.

Therefore Lift up your hearts! We lift them up to the Lord! Please be seated. How Shall We Then Live? Let us hear from God's Word. First Lesson Deuteronomy 7:6-9 6 For you are a holy people to the Lord your God; the Lord your God has chosen you to be a people for Himself, a special treasure above all the peoples on the face of the earth. 7 The Lord did not set His love on you nor choose you because you were more in number than any other people, for you were the least of all peoples; 8 but because the Lord loves you, and because He would keep the oath which He swore to your fathers, the Lord has brought you out with a mighty hand, and redeemed you from the house of bondage, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt. 9 Therefore know that the Lord your God, He is God, the faithful God who keeps covenant and mercy for a thousand generations with those who love Him and keep His commandments; The Word of the Lord! Thanks be to God! Second Lesson Romans 8:28-39 28 And we know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are the called according to His purpose. 29 For whom He foreknew, He also predestined to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the firstborn among many brethren. 30 Moreover whom He predestined, these He also called; whom He called, these He also justified; and whom He justified, these He also glorified. 31 What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us? 32 He who did not spare His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not with Him also freely give us all things? 33 Who shall bring a charge against God's elect? It is God who justifies. 34 Who is he who condemns? It is Christ who died, and furthermore is also risen, who is even at the right hand of God, who also makes intercession for us. 35 Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? 36 As it is written: For Your sake we are killed all day long; We are accounted as sheep for the slaughter. 37 Yet in all these things we are more than conquerors through Him who loved us. 38 For I am persuaded that neither death nor life, nor angels nor principalities nor powers, nor things present nor things to come, 39 nor height nor depth, nor any other created thing, shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. The Word of the Lord! Thanks be to God! (Now RISE for our Hymn) (Please remain standing for our Gospel Lesson and song) Gospel Lesson Matthew 6:25-34 The Gospel of the Kingdom!

Let us hear from God's Word. First Lesson Jeremiah 23:16-29 6 Thus says the Lord of hosts: Do not listen to the words of the prophets who prophesy to you. They make you worthless; They speak a vision of their own heart, Not from the mouth of the Lord. 17 They continually say to those who despise Me, ‘The Lord has said, You shall have peace '; And to everyone who walks according to the dictates of his own heart, they say, ‘No evil shall come upon you.' 18 For who has stood in the counsel of the Lord, And has perceived and heard His word? Who has marked His word and heard it? 19 Behold, a whirlwind of the Lord has gone forth in fury A violent whirlwind! It will fall violently on the head of the wicked. 20 The anger of the Lord will not turn back Until He has executed and performed the thoughts of His heart. In the latter days you will understand it perfectly. 21 I have not sent these prophets, yet they ran. I have not spoken to them, yet they prophesied. 22 But if they had stood in My counsel, And had caused My people to hear My words, Then they would have turned them from their evil way and from the evil of their doings. 23 Am I a God near at hand, says the Lord, And not a God afar off? 24 Can anyone hide himself in secret places, So I shall not see him? says the Lord; Do I not fill heaven and earth? says the Lord. 25 I have heard what the prophets have said who prophesy lies in My name, saying, ‘I have dreamed, I have dreamed!' 26 How long will this be in the heart of the prophets who prophesy lies? Indeed they are prophets of the deceit of their own heart, 27 who try to make My people forget My name by their dreams which everyone tells his neighbor, as their fathers forgot My name for Baal. 28 The prophet who has a dream, let him tell a dream; And he who has My word, let him speak My word faithfully. What is the chaff to the wheat? says the Lord. 29 Is not My word like a fire? says the Lord, And like a hammer that breaks the rock in pieces? The Word of the Lord! Thanks be to God! Second Lesson Galatians 5.13-26 13 For you, brethren, have been called to liberty; only do not use liberty as an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another. 14 For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. 15 But if you bite and devour one another, beware lest you be consumed by one another! 16 I say then: Walk in the Spirit, and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh. 17 For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; and these are contrary to one another, so that you do not do the things that you wish. 18 But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law. 19 Now the works of the flesh are evident, which are: adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lewdness, 20 idolatry, sorcery, hatred, contentions, jealousies, outbursts of wrath, selfish ambitions, dissensions, heresies, 21 envy, murders, drunkenness, revelries, and the like; of which I tell you beforehand, just as I also told you in time past, that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God. 22 But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, 23 gentleness, self-control. Against such there is no law. 24 And those who are Christ's have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires. 25 If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit. 26 Let us not become conceited, provoking one another, envying one another. The Word of the Lord! Thanks be to God! (Now RISE for our Gospel Lesson and song) Gospel Lesson Luke 12:49-56 The Gospel of the Kingdom! Praise be to the Lord Jesus Christ! Grant us the Light of Your Spirit now Father, that we might hear Your Word faithfully, For we ask it in Jesus name. AMEN. (please be seated) Preaching of the Word Presentation of Tithes and Offering DEUTERONOMY 15:7-8, 10-11 -- "" If there is among you a poor man of your brethren, within any of the gates in your land which the Lord your God is giving you, you shall not harden your heart nor shut your hand from your poor brother, but you shall open your hand wide to him and willingly lend him sufficient for his need, whatever he needs....You shall surely give to him, and your heart should not be grieved when you give to him, because for this thing the Lord your God will bless you in all your works and in all to which you put your hand. For the poor will never cease from the land; therefore I command you, saying, 'You shall open your hand wide to your brother, to your poor and your needy, in your land.' Our Gracious Heavenly Father, Give us the grace of Your Holy Spirit not to harden our hearts, nor grumble, nor close our hands to our poor brethren, knowing that Your word has forbidden it, and promised blessing because of it. We present these gifts to You today as tokens of ourselves, our minds, our bodies, our time, our talents, our interests, our possessions, and our whole personalities; all offered up to You for Your good pleasure.

But now we are Your workmanship, created in Christ Jesus, so continue to strengthen us by Your Spirit that we should walk in the good works which You have prepared before us. We pray this not only for ourselves but for all Your Church in all the world.

Sustain prisoners and kindly grant their release. Overthrow those who have targeted the Bride of Christ for destruction and who persecute Your people. Hasten the day when Mohammedism, Hinduism, and every other false religion of the world no longer deceives the nations, and each one is baptized and discipled in all the holy commandments of Your Son, Jesus Christ.

I believe in one God: the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth, and of all things visible and invisible; And in one Lord, Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son of God, begotten of His Father before all worlds, God of God, Light of Light, very God of very God, begotten, not made, being of one substance with the Father; by Whom all things were made; Who for us men, and for our salvation, came down from Heaven, and was incarnate by the Holy Ghost of the virgin, Mary, and was made man; and was crucified also for us under Pontius Pilate; He suffered, and was buried, and the third day He rose again according to the Scriptures; and ascended into Heaven, and sitteth at the right hand of the Father; and He shall come again with glory to judge both the quick and the dead; Whose kingdom shall have no end. And I believe in the Holy Ghost, the Lord and Giver of life, Who proceedeth from the Father and the Son; Who with the Father and the Son together is worshipped and glorified; Who spoke through the prophets. And I believe one, holy, catholic, and apostolic Church; I acknowledge one baptism for the remission of sins; and I look for the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come. Amen.

So bless us now, as we Your people, moved by your Holy Sprit, give you all thanks, praise, and glory, for ever and ever. Amen.

THE LORD IS MY ROCK AND MY FORTRESS AND MY DELIVERER; My God, my strength, in whom I will trust; MY SHIELD AND THE HORN OF MY SALVATION, MY STRONGHOLD. I will call upon the LORD, who is worthy to be praised; SO SHALL I BE SAVED FROM MY ENEMIES. The pangs of death surrounded me, AND THE FLOODS OF UNGODLINESS MADE ME AFRAID. The sorrows of Sheol surrounded me; THE SNARES OF DEATH CONFRONTED ME. In my distress I called upon the LORD, AND CRIED OUT TO MY GOD; He heard my voice from His temple, AND MY CRY CAME BEFORE HIM, EVEN TO HIS EARS. Entrance Hymn Psalm 40, I Waited for the LORD Praise belongs to You, O God, in Zion; and to You shall vows be performed, O God, our God Who hears prayer!

Now hear us as we sing together the prayer He has given us The Lord's Prayer (arr. Nikolai Kedrov) Our Father, who art in Heaven, THE LORD CLEANSES US < The Sin Offering > People of God, we are in need of His cleansing and renewal. Therefore, tet us kneel and confess our sins together, in humble reliance upon the grace of God, first silently then in unison. CONFESSION OF SIN.............................................(Kneeling if able) Let Us Pray Together Most merciful God, we confess that we have sinned against You in thought, word, and deed, by what we have done and by what we have left undone. We have not loved You with our whole heart; we have not loved our neighbor as ourselves. For the sake of Your Son, Jesus Christ, have mercy on us. Forgive us, renew us, and lead us, so that we may delight in Your will and walk in Your ways, to the glory of Your holy name. Amen. Arise and hear the good news of God's forgiveness! I waited patiently for the Lord; And He inclined to me, And heard my cry. He also brought me up out of a horrible pit, Out of the miry clay, And set my feet upon a rock, And established my steps. He has put a new song in my mouth -- Praise to our God; Many will see it and fear, And will trust in the Lord. Blessed is that man who makes the Lord his trust, And does not respect the proud, nor such as turn aside to lies. [To you who wait patiently for the Lord, who make the Lord your trust, God inclines to you, hears your cry, sets your feet upon a Rock, and for Christ's sake, forgives all your sin]. Therefore, Lift up your hearts! We lift them up to the Lord. Holy, Holy, Holy!Please be seated. First Lesson Job 38:4-18 4 Where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth? Tell Me, if you have understanding. 5 Who determined its measurements? Surely you know! Or who stretched the line upon it? 6 To what were its foundations fastened? Or who laid its cornerstone, when the morning stars sang together, And all the sons of God shouted for joy? 8 Or who shut in the sea with doors, When it burst forth and issued from the womb; 9 When I made the clouds its garment, And thick darkness its swaddling band; 10 When I fixed My limit for it, and set bars and doors; 11 When I said, ‘This far you may come, but no farther, And here your proud waves must stop!' 12 Have you commanded the morning since your days began, And caused the dawn to know its place, 13 That it might take hold of the ends of the earth, And the wicked be shaken out of it? 14 It takes on form like clay under a seal, and stands out like a garment. 15 From the wicked their light is withheld, and the upraised arm is broken. 16 Have you entered the springs of the sea? Or have you walked in search of the depths? 17 Have the gates of death been revealed to you? Or have you seen the doors of the shadow of death? 18 Have you comprehended the breadth of the earth? Tell Me, if you know all this. The Word of the Lord! Thanks be to God! Second Lesson Romans 10:5-17 5 For Moses writes about the righteousness which is of the law, The man who does those things shall live by them. 6 But the righteousness of faith speaks in this way, Do not say in your heart, ‘Who will ascend into heaven?' (that is, to bring Christ down from above) 7 or, ‘Who will descend into the abyss?' (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead). 8 But what does it say? The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart (that is, the word of faith which we preach): 9 that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. 10 For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. 11 For the Scripture says, Whoever believes on Him will not be put to shame. 12 For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord over all is rich to all who call upon Him. 13 For whoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved. 14 How then shall they call on Him in whom they have not believed? And how shall they believe in Him of whom they have not heard? And how shall they hear without a preacher? 15 And how shall they preach unless they are sent? As it is written: How beautiful are the feet of those who [a]preach the gospel of peace, Who bring glad tidings of good things! 16 But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Isaiah says, Lord, who has believed our report? 17 So then faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God. The Word of the Lord! Thanks be to God! (Please RISE for our Hymn) (Please remain standing for our Gospel Lesson and song) Gospel Lesson Matthew 7:7-12 The Gospel of the Kingdom! Praise be to the Lord Jesus Christ! The Gloria Patri Glory be to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Ghost! As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be. World without end. Amen, Amen! *PRAYER FOR ILLUMINATION Our Father, we approach You now by the work of Your Son. Bless us with Your Spirit now so that even just by touching the fringe of Your outer glory we may know You and be comforted, restored, and filled with faith and courage to give up our lives for Your service every day. Amen. (Please Be Seated) SERMON .. .. Pastor Ben Rossell Prayer of Consecration Presentation of Tithes and Offering DEUTERONOMY 24:19-22 -- ""When you reap your harvest in your field, and forget a sheaf in the field, you shall not go back to get it; it shall be left for the foreigner, the fatherless, and the widow, that the Lord your God may bless you in all the work of your hands. When you beat your olive trees, you shall not go over the branches a second time; it shall be left as it is for the foreigner, the fatherless, and the widow. When you gather the grapes of your vineyard, you shall not glean it a second time; it shall be left as it is for the foreigner, the fatherless, and the widow. And you shall remember that you were once a slave in the land of Egypt; for that reason I command you to do this thing. Our Gracious Heavenly Father, Give us Your own generous heart to be full of concern for the good of others, especially the foreigners, fatherless, and widows around us. We confess to You that Our attention is so focused on ourselves that we are often not even aware of the needs of others. Open our eyes to see them; open our hearts and our hands to our fellow men, that we would be particularly sensitive to those who may cross our path in Your providence, even this week. Empower Your Church by Your Holy Spirit to respond to the needy around us with wisdom and faithfulness. Bless these gifts which we offer You now along with ourselves, our time and energy, for Your work and Your glory. In Jesus' name. Amen. Rise now and let us pray for the Church and the World! #31 PRAYER FOR THE CHURCH AND THE WORLD Father, It's so hard for us to live by faith rather than by what we see and respond to in our immediate sense of things. Of all generations, ours is untrained at waiting with patience within time as You've created us to and as You teach us to in Your providence and Word. Forgive us for demanding to receive what we prefer right now, and for caring so little to even learn the patience of wisdom. Bear with us Lord, and grow us up in every way into Him Who is our Head, so that we may build Your Body up in love. We pray these things not only for ourselves but for all your Church in all the world. In our own community, we lift up to You Niceville Christian Church and their new pastor Jeff Thompson.

Good News Jail & Prison Ministries - increased opportunities to preach God's word in our local jails. For safety and blessing as the chaplains do this. Lastly, pray for the inmates, that they will truly hear His word and continue in their commitment to Christ not only during their time in jail, but especially after they are released. Outside of our community, we lift up to You our brothers and sisters in IRAN and for those who have been threatened and exiled and left destitute because they bear the name of Christ, families that have been separated and Christians that have been flogged for obeying you. Grant them Your comfort and raise up courageous and just men to protect them. Protect Your innocent ones there, establish the peace that allows Your Church to grow and flourish and bring the light of Your gospel to the blindness and false religion that shadows that land.

Forgive us, renew us, and lead us, so that we may delight in Your will and walk in Your ways, to the glory of Your holy name. Amen. Cleansing of Sin (Please Stand) Rise and Hear now God's assurance of forgiveness Come and hear, all you who fear God, And I will declare what He has done for my soul. I cried to Him with my mouth, And He was extolled with my tongue. If I regard iniquity in my heart, The Lord will not hear. But certainly God has heard me; He has attended to the voice of my prayer. Blessed be God, Who has not turned away my prayer, Nor His mercy from me! [Covenant people of God, the Lord has heard your cry; He has not turned away your prayer of confession, nor taken His mercy from You. For the sake of Jesus Christ His Son, He forgives all your sin]. Lift up your hearts! We lift them up to the Lord! Sanctus THE LORD CONSECRATES US (Please be seated) First Lesson Isaiah 56:1;6-8 56 Thus says the Lord: Keep justice, and do righteousness, For My salvation is about to come, And My righteousness to be revealed. 6 Also the sons of the foreigner Who join themselves to the Lord, to serve Him, And to love the name of the Lord, to be His servants Everyone who keeps from defiling the Sabbath, And holds fast My covenant 7 Even them I will bring to My holy mountain, And make them joyful in My house of prayer. Their burnt offerings and their sacrifices Will be accepted on My altar; For My house shall be called a house of prayer for all nations. 8 The Lord God, who gathers the outcasts of Israel, says, Yet I will gather to him Others besides those who are gathered to him. The Word of the Lord! Thanks be to God! Second Lesson Romans 11:1-20 11 I say then, has God cast away His people? Certainly not! For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin. 2 God has not cast away His people whom He foreknew. Or do you not know what the Scripture says of Elijah, how he pleads with God against Israel, saying, 3 Lord, they have killed Your prophets and torn down Your altars, and I alone am left, and they seek my life? 4 But what does the divine response say to him? I have reserved for Myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to Baal. 5 Even so then, at this present time there is a remnant according to the election of grace. 6 And if by grace, then it is no longer of works; otherwise grace is no longer grace. But if it is of works, it is no longer grace; otherwise work is no longer work. 7 What then? Israel has not obtained what it seeks; but the elect have obtained it, and the rest were blinded. 8 Just as it is written: God has given them a spirit of stupor, Eyes that they should not see And ears that they should not hear, To this very day. 9 And David says: Let their table become a snare and a trap, A stumbling block and a recompense to them. 10 Let their eyes be darkened, so that they do not see, And bow down their back always. 11 I say then, have they stumbled that they should fall? Certainly not! But through their fall, to provoke them to jealousy, salvation has come to the Gentiles. 12 Now if their fall is riches for the world, and their failure riches for the Gentiles, how much more their fullness! 13 For I speak to you Gentiles; inasmuch as I am an apostle to the Gentiles, I magnify my ministry, 14 if by any means I may provoke to jealousy those who are my flesh and save some of them. 15 For if their being cast away is the reconciling of the world, what will their acceptance be but life from the dead? 16 For if the firstfruit is holy, the lump is also holy; and if the root is holy, so are the branches. 17 And if some of the branches were broken off, and you, being a wild olive tree, were grafted in among them, and with them became a partaker of the root and fatness of the olive tree, 18 do not boast against the branches. But if you do boast, remember that you do not support the root, but the root supports you. 19 You will say then, Branches were broken off that I might be grafted in. 20 Well said. Because of unbelief they were broken off, and you stand by faith. Do not be haughty, but fear. The Word of the Lord! Thanks be to God!

Prayer for Illumination Revelation 1:1-3 Our Father, We feel our frailties this morning as we hear the words of Your Son revealing Himself to be the Bread of Life.

Our Gracious Heavenly Father, after the example of Old Covenant Israel, we present our offerings to You this morning, a tithe and token removed from our houses and taken to Your House as a testimony of remembrance and thanksgiving for the increase You have entrusted to us, and of love for You and our neighbors.

I believe in one God: the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth, and of all things visible and invisible; And in one Lord, Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son of God, begotten of His Father before all worlds, God of God, Light of Light, very God of very God, begotten, not made, being of one substance with the Father; by Whom all things were made; Who for us men, and for our salvation, came down from Heaven, and was incarnate by the Holy Ghost of the virgin, Mary, and was made man; and was crucified also for us under Pontius Pilate; He suffered, and was buried, and the third day He rose again according to the Scriptures; and ascended into Heaven, and sitteth at the right hand of the Father; and He shall come again with glory to judge both the quick and the dead; Whose kingdom shall have no end. And I believe in the Holy Ghost, the Lord and Giver of life, Who proceedeth from the Father and the Son; Who with the Father and the Son together is worshipped and glorified; Who spoke through the prophets. And I believe one, holy, catholic, and apostolic Church; I acknowledge one baptism for the remission of sins; and I look for the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come. Amen.

He will not always chide, nor will He keep His anger forever. He has not dealt with us according to our sins, nor rewarded us according to our iniquities. For as the heavens are high above the earth, so great is His steadfast love toward those who fear Him; as far as the east is from the west, so far has He removed our transgressions from us. [To all who confess your sin to God and seek His forgiveness, God declares that He does not deal with you according to your sin or reward you as your iniquities deserve, but has removed your transgressions as far from you as the east is from the west.

Let us hear from God's Word. First Lesson Isaiah 51:1-6 Listen to Me, you who follow after righteousness, You who seek the Lord: Look to the rock from which you were hewn, And to the hole of the pit from which you were dug. 2 Look to Abraham your father, And to Sarah who bore you; For I called him alone, And blessed him and increased him. 3 For the Lord will comfort Zion, He will comfort all her waste places; He will make her wilderness like Eden, And her desert like the garden of the Lord; Joy and gladness will be found in it, Thanksgiving and the voice of melody. 4 Listen to Me, My people; And give ear to Me, O My nation: For law will proceed from Me, And I will make My justice rest As a light of the peoples. 5 My righteousness is near, My salvation has gone forth, And My arms will judge the peoples; The coastlands will wait upon Me, And on My arm they will trust. 6 Lift up your eyes to the heavens, And look on the earth beneath. For the heavens will vanish away like smoke, The earth will grow old like a garment, And those who dwell in it will die in like manner; But My salvation will be forever, And My righteousness will not be abolished.

I will wash my hands in innocence; so I will go about your altar, O LORD, THAT I MAY PROCLAIM WITH THE VOICE OF THANKSGIVING, AND TELL OF ALL YOUR WONDROUS WORKS. Lord, I have loved the habitation of Your house, and the place where Your glory dwells. DO NOT GATHER MY SOUL WITH SINNERS, NOR MY LIFE WITH BLOODTHIRSTY MEN, In whose hands is a sinister scheme, and whose right hand is full of bribes. BUT AS FOR ME, I WILL WALK IN MY INTEGRITY; REDEEM ME AND BE MERCIFUL TO ME. My foot stands in an even place; IN THE CONGREGATIONS I WILL BLESS THE LORD. Entrance Hymn Beneath the Blood-Stained Lintel Baptism of Jacob Kendall Williams Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one! You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your strength. And these words which I command you today shall be in your heart. You shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in your house, when you walk by the way, when you lie down, and when you rise up For the promise is to you and to your children, and to all who are afar off, as many as the Lord our God will call. (Deut 6:4-7; Acts 2:39). DEARLY BELOVED, the sacrament of baptism is for little children because God our Father, Who has redeemed us by the sacrifice of Christ, is also the God and Father of our children. They belong, with us who believe, to the membership of the Church through the covenant made with Christ. Our own Westminster Confession of Faith says that baptism is a sign and seal of the covenant of grace, of our ingrafting into Christ, of regeneration, of remission of sins, and of our giving up unto God, through Jesus Christ, to walk in the newness of life. Our Lord Jesus said, Allow the little children to come unto Me, and do not forbid them, for of such is the kingdom of God. John and Blake, is Jesus Christ your only Lord and Savior? You know that, in presenting your son, that God requires things of you 1. In presenting your son for baptism, you are acknowledging your need and his of the cleansing blood of Jesus Christ and the renewing grace of the Holy Spirit. 2. You are claiming God's covenant promise in his behalf, God's promise to be a God to you and to your descendants after you, and you are looking in faith to the Lord Jesus Christ for his salvation, as you do for your own. 3. You are now unreservedly committing him to God, and promising, in humble reliance upon divine grace, that you will endeavor to set before him a Godly example, that you will pray with and for her, that you will teach him the doctrines of the Christian faith, and that you will strive, by all the means of God's appointment, to bring him up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord. These are the baptismal duties God requires of you do you vow to obey Him by His grace and help? [response: We do] QUESTION TO THE CONGREGATION: God calls you as the Body of Christ to assist these parents in the Christian nurture of this child? Will you respond with a hearty Amen and commit to undertake this responsibility by God's grace and help? AMEN What is this child's name? Jacob Kendall, I BAPTIZE YOU IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER AND THE SON AND THE HOLY SPIRIT. THE BLESSINGS OF THE TRIUNE GOD BE WITH YOU ALWAYS. Little boy, for you Jesus Christ came into the world, suffered and did battle. For you He faced the blackness of Gethsemane and the terrors of Calvary. For you He cried out It is finished! For you He overcame death by death, was buried, and ascended into Heaven, where for you, He is right now, interceding. All these things while you are too young to even know what they mean. And so the word of the Apostle is confirmed: We love Him because first, He loved us. DECLARATION: This child, being thus baptized, is a member of the household of faith; committed to the care and instruction of these parents and this congregation, to the end that he may mature and grow strong as a disciple of the Lord Jesus Christ, and serve in the royal priesthood of God's elect from every tribe and tongue and nation. Jesus said, Whoever receives one such little child in My name, receives Me. As you have seen this baptism, remember your own and vimprove and make right use of your baptism, stir up your faith; nurture it; feed it; exercise it; strengthen it and always be repenting of any sins against your covenant with God for there is a covenant sealed by your baptism betwixt God and your soul. Never forget it. It is a great honor and gift to belong to God in this way. Please rise for our prayer of blessing which we will close together by singing of the Lord's Prayer: Eternal and Almighty God, You righteously judged the unfaithful world through flood waters, but in Your great mercy, saved faithful Noah with his household. You drowned hard-hearted Pharaoh with all his army in the Sea, but led Your people Israel through on dry ground, prefiguring the washing of Your holy baptism. By the baptism of Your dear Son, You sanctified and set apart the Jordan River and all water for a saving flood, and an ample washing away of sins. Through Your same infinite mercy, graciously look down now upon Jesse, and bless him with a right faith in the Spirit, so that through this saving flood all that was born in him from Adam and all that has been added to it might be drowned and cleansed. Separate Jacob now from the unfaithful, and preserve him in the holy ark of Christendom dry and safe, ever fervent in spirit and joyful in hope to serve Your holy name, so that he, together with us and all Your Faithful, may worthily inherit Your promise of eternal life, through Christ Jesus our Lord. Now hear us as we sing the prayer He taught us: Prayer of Adoration: We Praise You our God, for Your goodness, mercy, and wisdom. You reject the evil and cut them off, But turn Your eyes and ears to the righteous, and save them out of all their troubles. You condemn the wicked, but always redeem the souls of Your servants. Yes, You turn and come near to the humble-hearted and repentant, Just as You did Your Righteous Son, in all His afflictions, While His very flesh was being torn, You guarded each of His bones so that not one was broken. So guard and be with us and hear us now as we sing together the prayer He has given us The Lord's Prayer (arr. Nikolai Kedrov) Our Father, who art in Heaven, Hallowed be Thy Name. Thy Kingdom Come. Thy will be done, on earth as it is in Heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, And forgive us our debts, as we forgive, our debtors. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For Thine is the Kingdom, and the Power, and the Glory. Forever and ever. Amen. THE LORD CLEANSES US Saints of God, we are in need of cleansing and renewal. Let us call upon the mercy of our heavenly Father. Let us kneel and confess our sins together, in humble reliance upon the grace of God, first silently, then together. Let us pray together Most merciful God, we confess that we have sinned against You in thought, word, and deed, by what we have done and by what we have left undone. We have not loved You with our whole heart; we have not loved our neighbor as ourselves. For the sake of Your Son, Jesus Christ, have mercy on us. Forgive us, renew us, and lead us, so that we may delight in Your will and walk in Your ways, to the glory of Your holy name. Amen. *DECLARATION OF FORGIVENESS: Arise and hear the good news of God's forgiveness! I JOHN 4:10 Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son to be the propitiation for our sins. [To all who confess your sin to God sincerely and seek His forgiveness, God declares His love for you, the love He made known by sending His Son, Who was the propitiation for our sins. Christian, for Christ's sake, all your sins are forgiven. Therefore, lift up your hearts!] Leader: Lift up your hearts! We lift them up to the Lord! Sanctus Please be seated. How Shall We Then Live? Let us hear from God's Word. First Lesson Jeremiah 15:15-21 Jeremiah 15:15-21 15 O Lord, You know; Remember me and [a]visit me, And take vengeance for me on my persecutors. In Your enduring patience, do not take me away. Know that for Your sake I have suffered rebuke. 16 Your words were found, and I ate them, And Your word was to me the joy and rejoicing of my heart; For I am called by Your name, O Lord God of hosts. 17 I did not sit in the assembly of the mockers, Nor did I rejoice; I sat alone because of Your hand, For You have filled me with indignation. 18 Why is my pain perpetual And my wound incurable, Which refuses to be healed? Will You surely be to me like an unreliable stream, As waters that [b]fail? 19 Therefore thus says the Lord: If you return, Then I will bring you back; You shall stand before Me; If you take out the precious from the vile, You shall be as My mouth. Let them return to you, But you must not return to them. 20 And I will make you to this people a fortified bronze wall; And they will fight against you, But they shall not prevail against you; For I am with you to save you And deliver you, says the Lord. 21 I will deliver you from the hand of the wicked, And I will redeem you from the grip of the terrible. The Word of the Lord! Thanks be to God! Second Lesson Romans 12:9-21 9 Let love be without hypocrisy. Abhor what is evil. Cling to what is good. 10 Be kindly affectionate to one another with brotherly love, in honor giving preference to one another; 11 not lagging in diligence, fervent in spirit, serving the Lord; 12 rejoicing in hope, patient[a] in tribulation, continuing steadfastly in prayer; 13 distributing to the needs of the saints, given[b] to hospitality. 14 Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse. 15 Rejoice with those who rejoice, and weep with those who weep. 16 Be of the same mind toward one another. Do not set your mind on high things, but associate with the humble. Do not be wise in your own opinion. 17 Repay no one evil for evil. Have[c] regard for good things in the sight of all men. 18 If it is possible, as much as depends on you, live peaceably with all men. 19 Beloved, do not avenge yourselves, but rather give place to wrath; for it is written, Vengeance is Mine, I will repay, says the Lord. 20 Therefore If your enemy is hungry, feed him; If he is thirsty, give him a drink; For in so doing you will heap coals of fire on his head. 21 Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.

We rejoice in the communion of the saints and rejoice to be partakers in that fellowship. Help us as we do so today and hear us in each of our petitions, for Jesus' sake. Amen.- Nicene Creed Christians, in Whom do you trust? I believe in one God: the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth, and of all things visible and invisible; And in one Lord, Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son of God, begotten of His Father before all worlds, God of God, Light of Light, very God of very God, begotten, not made, being of one substance with the Father; by Whom all things were made; Who for us men, and for our salvation, came down from Heaven, and was incarnate by the Holy Ghost of the virgin, Mary, and was made man; and was crucified also for us under Pontius Pilate; He suffered, and was buried, and the third day He rose again according to the Scriptures; and ascended into Heaven, and sitteth at the right hand of the Father; and He shall come again with glory to judge both the quick and the dead; Whose kingdom shall have no end. And I believe in the Holy Ghost, the Lord and Giver of life, Who proceedeth from the Father and the Son; Who with the Father and the Son together is worshipped and glorified; Who spoke through the prophets. And I believe one, holy, catholic, and apostolic Church; I acknowledge one baptism for the remission of sins; and I look for the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come. Amen. (Please Be Seated) LORD COMMUNES WITH US (Please be seated) Let us pray: We humbly beseech You, O merciful Father, to hear us; and because of Your almighty goodness bless and sanctify, with Your word and Spirit, these Your gifts and creations of bread and wine; that we, receiving them according to Your Son our Savior Jesus Christ's holy institution, in remembrance of His death and passion, may be partakers of His most blessed Body and Blood. And we ask that in Your fatherly goodness, You will mercifully accept this our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving; most humbly beseeching You to grant that, by the merits of death of your son Jesus Christ, and through faith in His blood, we and all Your whole Church, may obtain remission of our sins, and all other benefits of His passion. And here we offer to You, O Lord, ourselves, our souls and bodies, to be a reasonable, holy , and living sacrifice to you. Through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen. Holy Scripture says that our Lord Jesus, on the same night in which He was betrayed, took bread Communion Exhortation Bread Psalm 45, My Heart has Found a Ready Theme And when He had blessed the bread, He broke it and gave it to His disciples saying: ""Take, eat; this is My body which is broken for you; do this in remembrance of Me."" The body of Christ given for you! [elders stand] Let us pray! All glory be to You, Almighty God, our heavenly Father. Because of Your tender mercy, You gave Your only Son Jesus Christ to suffer death on the cross for our redemption; and did institute, and in His holy gospel command us to continue, a perpetual memory of His precious death and sacrifice, until His coming again. Therefore we Your humble servants, celebrate before Your Divine Majesty, with these Your holy gifts, which we now offer to You: the memorial Your Son has commanded us to make, remembering His blessed passion and precious death, His mighty resurrection and glorious ascension; giving to You most hearty thanks for the innumerable benefits procured to us by those sufferings, death, resurrection, and ascension, Who, together with You and the Holy Spirit, are worship and glorified as one God, now and forevermore. Amen. In the same manner He also took the cup also after supper Jesus said, ""This cup is the new covenant in My blood. This do, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of Me.""

For everlasting is His lovingkindness! Praise God from whom all blessing flow, Praise Him all creatures here below Praise Him above ye heavenly host, Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. Amen! This is our Lord's commission of His Church: ""Go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature. He who believes and is baptized will be saved; but he who does not believe will be condemned.

For in the time of trouble He shall hide me in His pavilion; In the secret place of His tabernacle He shall hide me; He shall set me high upon a rock. And now my head shall be lifted up above my enemies all around me; Therefore offer sacrifices of joy in His tabernacle; and sing, yes, sing praises to the LORD! Rise and let us worship God!

We shall be satisfied with the goodness of Your house, Your holy temple. BY AWESOME DEEDS IN RIGHTEOUSNESS YOU WILL ANSWER US, O GOD OF OUR SALVATION, You who are the confidence of all the ends of the earth, and the far-off seas; WHO ESTABLISHED THE MOUNTAINS BY HIS STRENGTH, CLOTHED WITH POWER; You who still the noise of the seas, THE NOISE OF THEIR WAVES, AND THE TUMULT OF THE PEOPLES. They also who dwell in the farthest parts are afraid of Your signs; YOU MAKE THE OUTGOINGS OF THE MORNING AND EVENING REJOICE. You visit the earth and water it, You greatly enrich it; THE RIVER OF GOD IS FULL OF WATER; YOU PROVIDE THEIR GRAIN, WHICH YOU HAVE PREPARED. You water its ridges abundantly, You settle its furrows; YOU MAKE IT SOFT WITH SHOWERS, YOU BLESS ITS GROWTH. You crown the year with Your goodness, and Your paths drip with abundance. THEY DROP ON THE PASTURES OF THE WILDERNESS, AND THE LITTLE HILLS REJOICE ON EVERY SIDE. The pastures are clothed with flocks; the valleys also are covered with grain; THEY SHOUT FOR JOY, THEY ALSO SING.

Forgive us, renew us, and lead us, so that we may delight in Your will and walk in Your ways, to the glory of Your holy name. Amen. Arise! and hear the good news of God's forgiveness from Isaiah 53:4-6 . Surely He has borne our griefs And carried our sorrows; Yet we esteemed Him stricken, Smitten by God, and afflicted. 5 But He was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities; The chastisement for our peace was upon Him, And by His stripes we are healed. 6 All we like sheep have gone astray; We have turned, every one, to his own way; And the LORD has laid on Him the iniquity of us all. In this Scripture, God promises us, His people, that He has taken away our iniquities, laid them on Christ, and for His sake, forgives all our sins. Therefore, Lift up your hearts! We lift them up to the Lord! Sanctus Holy, Holy, Holy - THE LORD CONSECRATES US (Please be seated) First Lesson Exodus 30:1-10; 34-38 You shall make an altar to burn incense on; you shall make it of acacia wood. 2 A cubit shall be its length and a cubit its width it shall be square and two cubits shall be its height. Its horns shall be of one piece with it. 3 And you shall overlay its top, its sides all around, and its horns with pure gold; and you shall make for it a molding of gold all around. 4 Two gold rings you shall make for it, under the molding on both its sides. You shall place them on its two sides, and they will be holders for the poles with which to bear it. 5 You shall make the poles of acacia wood, and overlay them with gold. 6 And you shall put it before the veil that is before the ark of the Testimony, before the mercy seat that is over the Testimony, where I will meet with you. 7 Aaron shall burn on it sweet incense every morning; when he tends the lamps, he shall burn incense on it. 8 And when Aaron lights the lamps at twilight, he shall burn incense on it, a perpetual incense before the Lord throughout your generations. 9 You shall not offer strange incense on it, or a burnt offering, or a grain offering; nor shall you pour a drink offering on it. 10 And Aaron shall make atonement upon its horns once a year with the blood of the sin offering of atonement; once a year he shall make atonement upon it throughout your generations. It is most holy to the Lord. 34 And the Lord said to Moses: Take sweet spices, stacte and onycha and galbanum, and pure frankincense with these sweet spices; there shall be equal amounts of each. 35 You shall make of these an incense, a compound according to the art of the perfumer, salted, pure, and holy. 36 And you shall beat some of it very fine, and put some of it before the Testimony in the tabernacle of meeting where I will meet with you. It shall be most holy to you. 37 But as for the incense which you shall make, you shall not make any for yourselves, according to its composition. It shall be to you holy for the Lord. 38 Whoever makes any like it, to smell it, he shall be cut off from his people. The Word of the Lord! Thanks be to God! Second Lesson Ephesians 2:12-22 11 Therefore remember that you, once Gentiles in the flesh who are called Uncircumcision by what is called the Circumcision made in the flesh by hands 12 that at that time you were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the world. 13 But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far off have been brought near by the blood of Christ. 14 For He Himself is our peace, who has made both one, and has broken down the middle wall of separation, 15 having abolished in His flesh the enmity, that is, the law of commandments contained in ordinances, so as to create in Himself one new man from the two, thus making peace, 16 and that He might reconcile them both to God in one body through the cross, thereby putting to death the enmity. 17 And He came and preached peace to you who were afar off and to those who were near. 18 For through Him we both have access by one Spirit to the Father. 19 Now, therefore, you are no longer strangers and foreigners, but fellow citizens with the saints and members of the household of God, 20 having been built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ Himself being the chief cornerstone, 21 in whom the whole building, being fitted together, grows into a holy temple in the Lord, 22 in whom you also are being built together for a dwelling place of God in the Spirit.

Amen. Nicene Creed Christians, in Whom do you trust? I believe in one God: the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth, and of all things visible and invisible; And in one Lord, Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son of God, begotten of His Father before all worlds, God of God, Light of Light, very God of very God, begotten, not made, being of one substance with the Father; by Whom all things were made; Who for us men, and for our salvation, came down from Heaven, and was incarnate by the Holy Ghost of the virgin, Mary, and was made man; and was crucified also for us under Pontius Pilate; He suffered, and was buried, and the third day He rose again according to the Scriptures; and ascended into Heaven, and sitteth at the right hand of the Father; and He shall come again with glory to judge both the quick and the dead; Whose kingdom shall have no end. And I believe in the Holy Ghost, the Lord and Giver of life, Who proceedeth from the Father and the Son; Who with the Father and the Son together is worshipped and glorified; Who spoke through the prophets. And I believe one, holy, catholic, and apostolic Church; I acknowledge one baptism for the remission of sins; and I look for the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come. Amen. Please be seated! Prayer giving thanks for the bread #10 (Adapted from An Order of Worship from the Reformed Church, 1899) Almighty God, our heavenly Father, we pray that You will send down the powerful benediction of Your Holy Spirit upon these elements of bread and wine, that they may become to us the sign and seal to us of the body and blood of Your Son Jesus Christ; so that in this use of them we may be made, through the power of the Holy Spirit, to partake really and truly of His blessed life, by which alone we can be saved from death, and raised to immortality at the last day. We give you heartfelt thanks for the Bread of Life and for this bread by which we now partake of Christ. In His blessed name. Amen.

Communion Exhortation Bread Only Begotten Word of God Eternal And when He had blessed the bread, Jesus broke it and gave it to His disciples saying: ""Take, eat; this is My body which is broken for you; do this in remembrance of Me.""

I will praise you, O Lord, with my whole heart. I WILL TELL OF ALL YOUR MARVELOUS WORKS. I will be glad and rejoice in you; I WILL SING PRAISE TO YOUR NAME, O MOST HIGH! Entrance Psalm 90:10-17 The days of our lives are seventy years; AND IF BY REASON OF STRENGTH THEY ARE EIGHTY YEARS, Yet their boast is only labor and sorrow; FOR IT IS SOON CUT OFF, AND WE FLY AWAY. Who knows the power of Your anger? FOR AS THE FEAR OF YOU, SO IS YOUR WRATH. So teach us to number our days, THAT WE MAY GAIN A HEART OF WISDOM. Return, O Lord! How long? AND HAVE COMPASSION ON YOUR SERVANTS. Oh, satisfy us early with Your mercy, THAT WE MAY REJOICE AND BE GLAD ALL OUR DAYS! Make us glad according to the days in which You have afflicted us, THE YEARS IN WHICH WE HAVE SEEN EVIL. Let Your work appear to Your servants, AND YOUR GLORY TO THEIR CHILDREN. And let the beauty of the Lord our God be upon us, AND ESTABLISH THE WORK OF OUR HANDS FOR US; YES, ESTABLISH THE WORK OF OUR HANDS. Entrance Hymn Beneath the Blood-Stained Lintel Centuries ago, the Christian ministers who wrote our Westminster statement of faith - understood baptismal water to represent the blood of Christ that washes away our sins and the virtue of the Holy Spirit that strengthens us to live holy lives, battling sin and temptation. Children are baptized because, in the Bible, God's covenant promises are made to believers and their households. Jesus welcomed little children into His presence, embracing and blessing them, saying, of such is the kingdom of God. Children born within the church, have, by their birth, interest in the covenant, and a right to it. So every baptized child is solemnly received into the bosom of the visible church, separated from the world, and all outsiders, and united with believers to join with us in their common baptismal duty, for all of us who are baptized in the name of Christ, by our baptism are bound to fight against the devil, the world, and the flesh: Caleb and Claire, is Jesus Christ your only Lord and Savior? You know that, in presenting your son, that God requires things of you 1. In presenting your son for baptism, you are acknowledging your need and his of the cleansing blood of Jesus Christ and the renewing grace of the Holy Spirit. 2. You are claiming God's covenant promise in his behalf, God's promise to be a God to you and to your descendants after you, and you are looking in faith to the Lord Jesus Christ for his salvation, as you do for your own. 3. You are now unreservedly committing him to God, and promising, in humble reliance upon divine grace, that you will endeavor to set before him a Godly example, that you will pray with and for him, that you will teach him the doctrines of the Christian faith, and that you will strive, by all the means of God's appointment, to bring him up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord. These are the baptismal duties God requires of you do you vow to obey Him by His grace and help? [response: We do] QUESTION TO THE CONGREGATION: God calls you as the Body of Christ to assist these parents in the Christian nurture of this child? Will you respond with a hearty Amen and commit to undertake this responsibility by God's grace and help? AMEN We thank you Father, that You have not left us as strangers without the covenant of promise, but called us to the privileges of adoption. Join the inward blessing of Your Holy Spirit to this outward washing of water and seal to this boy all the promises of the covenant of grace so that, planted into the likeness of Christ's death and resurrection; the body of sin being destroyed in him, he may serve God in newness of life all his days. Through Christ our Lord, Amen. What is this child's name? Andrew, I BAPTIZE YOU IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER AND THE SON AND THE HOLY SPIRIT. THE BLESSINGS OF THE TRIUNE GOD BE WITH YOU ALWAYS. Our forefathers in the faith were careful to teach that the virtue of baptism is not tied to the moment of time it is administered; but that its fruit and power extend to the whole course of our lives. So I call upon all of us here who have been baptized in the name of Christ - turn around - look back to your own baptism; repent always of every sin against your covenant with God; always be stirring up your faith; and day by day remember and live out the covenant sealed betwixt God and your soul. And to each of us who are Christian parents, Consider again the great mercy of our God to us, and to our beloved children that they would be brought up grounded in Christian truth and nurtured and disciplined in Christ. Let us be faithful in this urgent task remembering also the danger of God's wrath toward us and our children if we are negligent in our divine calling. Please rise and pray with me! Heavenly Father, we thank You for being true and faithful in keeping covenant and mercy: And for Your grace not only numbering us among Your saints but also bestowing upon our children this singular token and badge of Your love in Christ, purchased with His own blood. Daily confirm more and more Your unspeakable favour to this boy we have today received into the household of faith. Provide for and defend him as his heavenly father, and as he grows, teach him by Your word and Spirit, and make his baptism effectual to him, so that in Your power, he may prevail against the devil, the world, and the flesh, till in the end he obtain a full and final victory, and so be kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Now Hear us as we sing together the prayer Your Son has taught us We praise You, O God, we acknowledge You to be the LORD all the earth worships YOU, the Father everlasting To YOU all the angels cry aloud, the Heavens and all the Powers therein to You the Cherubim and Seraphim continually cry out the holiness of the Lord of Hosts Heaven and Earth are full of the Majesty of YOUR glory The glorious company of the Apostle praise You The goodly fellowship of the Prophets praise You The noble army of martyrs praise You And the Holy Church throughout all the world acknowledges You the Father, infinite in majesty; the honorable, true, and only Son, and the Holy Spirit, our Comforter. Here us now as we add our voices to these singing together the prayer our Lord Jesus has given The Lord's Prayer (arr. Nikolai Kedrov) Our Father, who art in Heaven, Hallowed be Thy Name. Thy Kingdom Come. Thy will be done, on earth as it is in Heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, And forgive us our debts, as we forgive, our debtors. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For Thine is the Kingdom, and the Power, and the Glory. Forever and ever. Amen. People of God, we are in need of His cleansing and renewal. Therefore, let us kneel and confess our sins together, in humble reliance upon the grace of God, first silently then in unison. LET US PRAY TOGETHER Most merciful god, I confess to you that I am from birth sinful and unclean, and that I have sinned against you in thought, word, and deed; not only in outward transgressions, but also in secret thoughts and desires that I am not able to fully understand, but which are all known to you. For this reason, I flee for refuge to your infinite mercy, continually seeking and imploring your grace, through my Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. * Arise and hear the good news of God's forgiveness! Isaiah 55 Seek the Lord while He may be found, Call upon Him while He is near. 7 Let the wicked forsake his way, And the unrighteous man his thoughts; Let him return to the Lord, And He will have mercy on him; Return to our God, For He will abundantly pardon. To you who have sought the Lord's mercy by confessing your sins and turning from unrighteous thoughts to the way of His Son God assures you once more than He has heard your prayers and for Christ's sake forgives all your sins. Therefore Lift up your hearts! We lift them up to the Lord! Sanctus Please be seated. How Shall We Then Live? Let us hear from God's Word. First Lesson Genesis 1:26-31 26 Then God said, Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness; let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the air, and over the cattle, over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth. 27 So God created man in His own image; in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them. 28 Then God blessed them, and God said to them, Be fruitful and multiply; fill the earth and subdue it; have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the air, and over every living thing that moves on the earth. 29 And God said, See, I have given you every herb that yields seed which is on the face of all the earth, and every tree whose fruit yields seed; to you it shall be for food. 30 Also, to every beast of the earth, to every bird of the air, and to everything that creeps on the earth, in which there is life, I have given every green herb for food; and it was so. 31 Then God saw everything that He had made, and indeed it was very good. So the evening and the morning were the sixth day. The Word of the Lord! Thanks be to God! Second Lesson I Timothy 5:3-8 3 Honor widows who are really widows. 4 But if any widow has children or grandchildren, let them first learn to show piety at home and to repay their parents; for this is good and acceptable before God. 5 Now she who is really a widow, and left alone, trusts in God and continues in supplications and prayers night and day. 6 But she who lives in pleasure is dead while she lives. 7 And these things command, that they may be blameless. 8 But if anyone does not provide for his own, and especially for those of his household, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever. The Word of the Lord! Thanks be to God! (Please RISE for our Hymn) (Please Remain Standing for our Gospel Lesson and song) Gospel Lesson Matthew 20.1-16 The Gospel of the Kingdom!

No garb of pomp or power He wore, a servant's form, like mine, He bore, To lead the devil captive. 6. He sweetly said: Hold fast by Me, I am thy Rock and Castle; Thy ransom I Myself will be, for thee I strive and wrestle; For I am with thee, I am thine, and evermore thou shalt be mine.

Let us hear from God's Word. First Lesson Ezekiel 18:1-4; 25-32 18 The word of the Lord came to me again, saying, 2 What do you mean when you use this proverb concerning the land of Israel, saying: ‘The fathers have eaten sour grapes, And the children's teeth are set on edge'? 3 As I live, says the Lord God, you shall no longer use this proverb in Israel. 4 Behold, all souls are Mine; The soul of the father As well as the soul of the son is Mine; The soul who sins shall die. 25 Yet you say, ‘The way of the Lord is not fair.' Hear now, O house of Israel, is it not My way which is fair, and your ways which are not fair? 26 When a righteous man turns away from his righteousness, commits iniquity, and dies in it, it is because of the iniquity which he has done that he dies. 27 Again, when a wicked man turns away from the wickedness which he committed, and does what is lawful and right, he preserves himself alive. 28 Because he considers and turns away from all the transgressions which he committed, he shall surely live; he shall not die. 29 Yet the house of Israel says, ‘The way of the Lord is not fair.' O house of Israel, is it not My ways which are fair, and your ways which are not fair? 30 Therefore I will judge you, O house of Israel, every one according to his ways, says the Lord God. Repent, and turn from all your transgressions, so that iniquity will not be your ruin. 31 Cast away from you all the transgressions which you have committed, and get yourselves a new heart and a new spirit. For why should you die, O house of Israel? 32 For I have no pleasure in the death of one who dies, says the Lord God. Therefore turn and live! The Word of the Lord! Thanks be to God! Second Lesson Romans 8:18-39 18 For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us. 19 For the earnest expectation of the creation eagerly waits for the revealing of the sons of God. 20 For the creation was subjected to futility, not willingly, but because of Him who subjected it in hope; 21 because the creation itself also will be delivered from the bondage of [f]corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God. 22 For we know that the whole creation groans and labors with birth pangs together until now. 23 Not only that, but we also who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, eagerly waiting for the adoption, the redemption of our body. 24 For we were saved in this hope, but hope that is seen is not hope; for why does one still hope for what he sees? 25 But if we hope for what we do not see, we eagerly wait for it with perseverance. 26 Likewise the Spirit also helps in our weaknesses. For we do not know what we should pray for as we ought, but the Spirit Himself makes intercession [g]for us with groanings which cannot be uttered. 27 Now He who searches the hearts knows what the mind of the Spirit is, because He makes intercession for the saints according to the will of God. 28 And we know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are the called according to His purpose. 29 For whom He foreknew, He also predestined to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the firstborn among many brethren. 30 Moreover whom He predestined, these He also called; whom He called, these He also justified; and whom He justified, these He also glorified. 31 What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us? 32 He who did not spare His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not with Him also freely give us all things? 33 Who shall bring a charge against God's elect? It is God who justifies. 34 Who is he who condemns? It is Christ who died, and furthermore is also risen, who is even at the right hand of God, who also makes intercession for us. 35 Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? 36 As it is written: For Your sake we are killed all day long; We are accounted as sheep for the slaughter. 37 Yet in all these things we are more than conquerors through Him who loved us. 38 For I am persuaded that neither death nor life, nor angels nor principalities nor powers, nor things present nor things to come, 39 nor height nor depth, nor any other created thing, shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. The Word of the Lord! Thanks be to God! (Now RISE for our Hymn) Gospel Lesson Matthew 21:23-32 The Gospel of the Kingdom! Praise be to the Lord Jesus Christ! The Gloria Patri Glory be to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Ghost! As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be. World without end. Amen, Amen!

Entrance Hymn Come Thou Fount Entrance Psalm 80:7-19 Restore us, O God of hosts; CAUSE YOUR FACE TO SHINE, AND WE SHALL BE SAVED! You have brought a vine out of Egypt; YOU HAVE CAST OUT THE NATIONS, AND PLANTED IT. You prepared room for it, AND CAUSED IT TO TAKE DEEP ROOT, AND IT FILLED THE LAND. The hills were covered with its shadow, AND THE MIGHTY CEDARS WITH ITS BOUGHS. She sent out her boughs to the Sea, AND HER BRANCHES TO THE RIVER. Why have You broken down her hedges, SO THAT ALL WHO PASS BY THE WAY PLUCK HER FRUIT? The boar out of the woods uproots it, AND THE WILD BEAST OF THE FIELD DEVOURS IT. Return, we beseech You, O God of hosts; LOOK DOWN FROM HEAVEN AND SEE, AND VISIT THIS VINE And the vineyard which Your right hand has planted, AND THE BRANCH THAT YOU MADE STRONG FOR YOURSELF. It is burned with fire, it is cut down; THEY PERISH AT THE REBUKE OF YOUR COUNTENANCE. Let Your hand be upon the man of Your right hand, UPON THE SON OF MAN WHOM YOU MADE STRONG FOR YOURSELF. Then we will not turn back from You; REVIVE US, AND WE WILL CALL UPON YOUR NAME. Restore us, O LORD God of hosts; CAUSE YOUR FACE TO SHINE, AND WE SHALL BE SAVED! Great God and Heavenly Father, we have come into Your holy presence, at Your call in order to bring our praises and offerings, and to present ourselves to You, the One in Whom is all strength and beauty. All the gods of the peoples are worthless idols and vain pursuits. You alone are to be feared. You alone are worthy to receive the worship of the nations of the earth. Before You they will bow and every tongue confess Your glory in Christ Jesus. Hear Your people's cry and hasten the coming of that day as we sing the prayer Your Son has graciously given us The Lord's Prayer (arr. Nikolai Kedrov) Our Father, who art in Heaven, Hallowed be Thy Name. Thy Kingdom Come. Thy will be done, on earth as it is in Heaven.

For Thine is the Kingdom, and the Power, and the Glory. Forever and ever. Amen. THE LORD CLEANSES US Saints of God, once more, we stand in need of our Father's cleansing and renewal.

We'll pray first silently, and then join together for our corporate prayer of confession, printed in your bulletins. (Kneeling if able) LET US PRAY TOGETHER Most merciful God, we confess that we have sinned against You in thought, word, and deed, by what we have done and by what we have left undone. We have not loved You with our whole heart; we have not loved our neighbor as ourselves. For the sake of Your Son, Jesus Christ, have mercy on us. Forgive us, renew us, and lead us, so that we may delight in Your will and walk in Your ways, to the glory of Your holy name. Amen. Arise and hear the good news of God's forgiveness! Micah 7:18-20 [The prophet Micah asked]: Who is a God like You, Pardoning iniquity And passing over the transgression of the remnant of His heritage? He does not retain His anger forever, Because He delights in mercy. He will again have compassion on us, And will subdue our iniquities. You will cast all our sins Into the depths of the sea. You will give truth to Jacob And mercy to Abraham, Which You have sworn to our fathers From days of old. [Our heavenly Father, in His great mercy, has given His only Son to die for us, and for His sake forgives all our sins. To all who confess their sin to God and seek His forgiveness, He passes over your transgression and has compassion on you; He casts all your sins into the depths of the sea]. Lift up your hearts! We lift them up to the Lord! Sanctus Please be seated. How Shall We Then Live? Let us hear from God's Word. First Lesson Isaiah 5:1-7 Now let me sing to my Well-beloved A song of my Beloved regarding His vineyard: My Well-beloved has a vineyard On a very fruitful hill. 2 He dug it up and cleared out its stones, And planted it with the choicest vine. He built a tower in its midst, And also made a winepress in it; So He expected it to bring forth good grapes, But it brought forth wild grapes. 3 And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem and men of Judah, Judge, please, between Me and My vineyard. 4 What more could have been done to My vineyard That I have not done in it? Why then, when I expected it to bring forth good grapes, Did it bring forth wild grapes? 5 And now, please let Me tell you what I will do to My vineyard: I will take away its hedge, and it shall be burned; And break down its wall, and it shall be trampled down. 6 I will lay it waste; It shall not be pruned or dug, But there shall come up briers and thorns. I will also command the clouds That they rain no rain on it. 7 For the vineyard of the Lord of hosts is the house of Israel, And the men of Judah are His pleasant plant. He looked for justice, but behold, oppression; For righteousness, but behold, a cry for help. The Word of the Lord! Thanks be to God! Second Lesson 2 Timothy 1:1-7 1 Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, according to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus, 2 To Timothy, a beloved son: Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord. 3 I thank God, whom I serve with a pure conscience, as my forefathers did, as without ceasing I remember you in my prayers night and day, 4 greatly desiring to see you, being mindful of your tears, that I may be filled with joy, 5 when I call to remembrance the genuine faith that is in you, which dwelt first in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice, and I am persuaded is in you also. 6 Therefore I remind you to stir up the gift of God which is in you through the laying on of my hands. 7 For God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of a sound mind.

Can faith save him? If a brother or sister is naked and destitute of daily food, and one of you says to them, ""Depart in peace, be warmed and filled,"" but you do not give them the things which are needed for the body, what does it profit? Thus also faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead. Our Gracious Heavenly Father, We thank You for the bounty of Your kind provision to us and pray for those in the world and in our community, especially our brothers and sisters in Christ, who are in poverty.

Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are moth-eaten. Your gold and silver are corroded, and their corrosion will be a witness against you and will eat your flesh like fire. You have heaped up treasure in the last days. Indeed the wages of the laborers who mowed your fields, which you kept back by fraud, cry out; and the cries of the reapers have reached the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth. You have lived on the earth in pleasure and luxury; you have fattened your hearts as in a day of slaughter. Our Gracious Heavenly Father, You have blessed us materially with great abundance so that luxuries of all kinds surround us every day and make our living pleasant and easy. Keep us from being rich fools, and laying up treasure for ourselves, while not being rich toward God (Luke 6:19-20). Grant us the grace and wisdom of Your Holy Spirit to think Your Own thoughts about money and material possessions. Deliver us from making idols of personal peace and affluence while ignoring the needs of those You have sent to us. Receive these gifts we present to You now.

I believe in one God: the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth, and of all things visible and invisible; And in one Lord, Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son of God, begotten of His Father before all worlds, God of God, Light of Light, very God of very God, begotten, not made, being of one substance with the Father; by Whom all things were made; Who for us men, and for our salvation, came down from Heaven, and was incarnate by the Holy Ghost of the virgin, Mary, and was made man; and was crucified also for us under Pontius Pilate; He suffered, and was buried, and the third day He rose again according to the Scriptures; and ascended into Heaven, and sitteth at the right hand of the Father; and He shall come again with glory to judge both the quick and the dead; Whose kingdom shall have no end. And I believe in the Holy Ghost, the Lord and Giver of life, Who proceedeth from the Father and the Son; Who with the Father and the Son together is worshipped and glorified; Who spoke through the prophets.

Forgive us, renew us, and lead us, so that we may delight in Your will and walk in Your ways, to the glory of Your holy name. Amen. Arise and hear the good news of God's forgiveness! Hear now the comforting assurance of the grace of God, promised in the Gospel to all who believe. Holy Scripture says: For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him might not perish, but have everlasting life. All who continue to love their sin and shame, and persist in them, even against the conviction of their own conscience, I must declare to you, by God's command, that His wrath and judgment abides upon you, and that your sins are retained in heaven, and you will not be delivered from eternal judgment, unless you repent. But, to every one of you beloved brothers and sisters, who hate your sins, and seek pardon through the merits of Jesus Christ alone, and who resolve each day to turn from your sins and to the Lord, to serve Him in true holiness and righteousness: I declare, according to God's command, that from heaven you are released from all your sins (as Christ has promised in His Gospel), through the perfect satisfaction of the most holy passion and death of our Lord Jesus Christ. And since we do not doubt that our prayers and worship are sanctified by the sufferings of Jesus Christ, and therefore acceptable and well-pleasing to God, I call upon you now, to Lift up your hearts!

94,2023-10-29,"October 29, 2023 Reformation Sunday Psalm 96 - Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised; He is to be feared above all gods. For all the gods of the peoples are idols; but the Lord made the heavens. Worship the Lord in holy array; tremble before Him, all the earth! Declare among the nations, ""The Lord reigns! Rise! Let us worship God! We are gathered in the name of God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit. Amen. I rejoiced when they said to me, Let us go into the house of the Lord! OUR FEET ARE STANDING WITHIN YOUR GATES, O JERUSALEM! Our help is in the name of the Lord MAKER OF HEAVEN AND EARTH. Beneath the Blood-Stained Lintel Entrance Psalm Psalm 46 God is our refuge and strength, A VERY PRESENT HELP IN TROUBLE. Therefore, we will not fear, though the earth be removed, AND THOUGH THE MOUNTAINS BE CARRIED INTO THE MIDST OF THE SEA; Though it waters roar and be troubled, THOUGH THE MOUNTAINS SHAKE WITH ITS SWELLING. There is a river whose streams shall make glad the city of God, THE HOLY PLACE OF THE TABERNACLE OF THE MOST-HIGH. God is in the midst of her, she shall not be moved; GOD SHALL HELP HER, JUST AT THE BREAK OF DAWN. The nations raged, the kingdoms were moved; HE UTTERED HIS VOICE, THE EARTH MELTED. The Lord of hosts is with us; THE GOD OF JACOB IS OUR REFUGE. Come, behold the works of the Lord, WHO HAS MADE DESOLATIONS IN THE EARTH. He makes wars cease to the ends of the earth; HE BREAKS THE BOW AND CUTS THE SPEAR IN TWO; He burns the chariot in the fire. BE STILL, AND KNOW THAT I AM GOD; I will be exalted among the nations, I WILL BE EXALTED IN THE EARTH! The Lord of hosts is with us; THE GOD OF JACOB IS OUR REFUGE. Baptism of Drennan Household! There is a river whose streams make the city of God glad (Ps 46). The Christian ministers who wrote our Westminster statement of faith - understood baptismal water to represent the blood of Christ that washes away our sins and the virtue of the Holy Spirit that strengthens us to live holy lives, battling sin and temptation. Today, we add into the membership of this church, the Drennans but as we prepared to do this, the Drennans were good and honest enough to tell us they don't believe they've ever been baptized. So here they are today to see it done. Now, each of them has been a believer for years, and it would have been an easy thing for them to just fudge on this detail and squeak on through But this is what REAL living faith looks like and does Real, living faith says I trust God and I'm going to obey Him even when I have to humble myself. Even when I don't understand it completely, I'm going to obey. As we saw last Lord's Day baptism is not nothing, nor is baptism everything. But baptism is something and something very important. By baptism we God officially places us into the bosom of the visible church, separated from the world, and all outsiders, and united with believers to join with us in their common baptismal duty, for all of us who are baptized in the name of Christ, by our baptism are bound to fight against the devil, the world, and the flesh. Today, the Drennans testify to this. Do you renounce the Devil with all his works, the vanity of the world, and the sinful desires of your flesh? Do you believe in the truths of the Christian faith as we confess them each week in the Nicene Creed? Do you want to be baptized? And to you, congregation, God calls you to receive this family into the household of faith, to build them up in Christ, and strengthen them on their way to follow Him through this life. Will you affirm with a hearty AMEN that you understand your part in their Christian discipleship as baptized members of this church? AMEN! Let us pray: We thank you Father, that You have not left us as strangers without the covenant of promise, but called us to the privileges of adoption. Join the inward blessing of Your Holy Spirit to this outward washing of water and seal to these three all the promises of the covenant of grace so that, planted into the likeness of Christ's death and resurrection; the body of sin being destroyed in them, they may serve God in newness of life all his days. Through Christ our Lord, Amen. Billy, I baptize you in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Angalee, I baptize you in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Noah, I baptize you in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. These three saints, being thus baptized, are members of the household of faith; committed to the care and instruction of this congregation, to the end that they may grow strong as disciples of the Lord Jesus Christ, and serve in the royal priesthood of God's elect from every tribe and tongue and nation. Jesus said, Whoever receives one such little child in My name, receives Me. As you have had to look back for this baptism, look back also to your own. Improve it and make the right use of it. Stir up your faith; nurture and feed it; exercise and strengthen it. And always be repenting of any sin against your covenant God. For there is a coenant sealed by your baptism betwixt God and your soul. Never forget it. Live so as to honor the gift all your days. Please pray with me: Heavenly Father, we thank You for being true and faithful in keeping covenant and mercy: And for Your grace to number us among Your saints and to bestow upon us the singular token and badge of Your love in Christ, purchased with His own blood. Daily confirm more and more Your unspeakable favour to each of these three we have today received into the household of faith. Provide for and defend them as their heavenly father, and make their baptism effectual, so that in Your power, each may prevail against the devil, the world, and the flesh, till in the end they obtain a full and final victory, each one kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation, Now hear us as we sing together the prayer our Lord has taught us Our Father, who art in Heaven, Hallowed be Thy Name. Thy Kingdom Come. Thy will be done, on earth as it is in Heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, And forgive us our debts, as we forgive, our debtors. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For Thine is the Kingdom, and the Power, and the Glory. Forever and ever. Amen. THE LORD CLEANSES US Saints of God, today we remember the work of God to reform His Church a work of reforming that God works always first and foremost in and from our own hearts we are in need of cleansing and renewal. Let us call upon the mercy of our heavenly Father. Let us kneel and confess our sins together, in humble reliance upon the grace of God, first silently, then together. Let us pray together Most merciful God, we confess that we have sinned against You in thought, word, and deed, by what we have done and by what we have left undone. We have not loved You with our whole heart; we have not loved our neighbor as ourselves. For the sake of Your Son, Jesus Christ, have mercy on us. Forgive us, renew us, and lead us, so that we may delight in Your will and walk in Your ways, to the glory of Your holy name. Amen. Cleansing of Sin Arise and hear the good news of God's forgiveness! Romans 3:19-22 Now we know that whatever the law says, it says to those who are under the law, that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God. Therefore by the deeds of the law no flesh will be justified in His sight, for by the law is the knowledge of sin. But now the righteousness of God apart from the law is revealed, being witnessed by the Law and the Prophets, even the righteousness of God which is through faith in Jesus Christ to all and on all who believe. [ To you who confess your sin to God and seek His forgiveness through Jesus, to you who have stopped your mouth from excuse-making and self justification, and have confessed that with all the world you stand guilty before God God declares that you are righteous in His sight together with all who believe in Jesus. Beloved in the Lord, for Christ's sake, all your sins are forgiven. Therefore ] Lift up your hearts! We lift them up to the Lord! Please be seated. First Lesson Revelation 14:6-7 6 Then I saw another angel flying in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach to those who dwell on the earth to every nation, tribe, tongue, and people 7 saying with a loud voice, Fear God and give glory to Him, for the hour of His judgment has come; and worship Him who made heaven and earth, the sea and springs of water.

I believe in one God: the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth, and of all things visible and invisible; And in one Lord, Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son of God, begotten of His Father before all worlds, God of God, Light of Light, very God of very God, begotten, not made, being of one substance with the Father; by Whom all things were made; Who for us men, and for our salvation, came down from Heaven, and was incarnate by the Holy Ghost of the virgin, Mary, and was made man; and was crucified also for us under Pontius Pilate; He suffered, and was buried, and the third day He rose again according to the Scriptures; and ascended into Heaven, and sitteth at the right hand of the Father; and He shall come again with glory to judge both the quick and the dead; Whose kingdom shall have no end. And I believe in the Holy Ghost, the Lord and Giver of life, Who proceedeth from the Father and the Son; Who with the Father and the Son together is worshiped and glorified; Who spoke through the prophets. And I believe one, holy, catholic, and apostolic Church; I acknowledge one baptism for the remission of sins; and I look for the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come. Amen. PLEASE BE SEATED. THE LORD COMMUNES WITH US (Please be seated) in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Amen.
