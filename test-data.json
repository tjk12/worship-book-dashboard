The rocket flew straight up and then the wind pushed it towards first base - it landed on the road. The parachute opened properly and then the wind caught the rocket on its descent and pushed it into the fence near first base. Smoke came out of the bottom of the rocket - likely from the engine. Smelled really bad. Pictures"
