The predicted altitude was 23 feet. The rocket ""shot high and to the left"". The parachute ""came straight out"" and the rocket spun on its way to the ground. It landed on the grass next to the first base fence. This rocket won the challenge for this class. Pictures"

The predicted altitude was 100 meters. The rocket flew straight up, and when the parachute deployed, the payload section was not attached to the parachute. The rocket flipped through the air on the way down. The flight ""didn't go as planned"". The coupler was not fit well enough into the payload section. Egg crashed into the dirt on the field between first and second base. Pictures"

The predicted altitude was 275 feet. The rocket flew straight up and then the wind pushed it towards first base - it landed on the road. The parachute opened properly and then the wind caught the rocket on its descent and pushed it into the fence near first base. Smoke came out of the bottom of the rocket - likely from the engine. Smelled really bad. Pictures"
